![Facebook](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-07-Facebook.png) So Facebook [just released video calling](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14054860) integration into Facebook chat. Great, now I can video call with all my friends. But hang on, I already have many of my friends on Skype. And all my iOS and Mac using friends can FaceTime me. On Google Plus? We can hangout there.  When is this going to stop? When Apple released Facetime, they assured us that they would release the standard for everyone to use. And yet, I can't see any non-Apple products using Facetime. Somebody needs to set standards so all of these services are inter-operable. Facebook's video calling is using Skype technology, but can I call a Skype user from Facebook? Nope. Can I Facetime a windows user? Nope. Let's get this sorted. Please. Rant over.
