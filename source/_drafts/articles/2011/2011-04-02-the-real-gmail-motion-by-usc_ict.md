If you were on the internet at any point yesterday, you probably saw that Gmail 'announced' [Gmail Motion](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/motion.html). This was, of course, another one Google's trademark April Fool's pranks. It was only a matter of time but here it is, Gmail Motion, using a Kinect Camera, courtesy of the University of California's [Institute of Creative Technologies](http://ict.usc.edu/).  Is there no limit to what can be done with [Kinect](http://kinecthacks.net/)?
