Here's Lovefilm's current steps for cancelling an account:

>   1. Go to your Rental List page – check that no new discs are being sent to you.
>   2. Go to your My Account page – check your "next scheduled billing date", to ensure you have enough time to return any discs to us.
>   3. Call to cancel free of charge on 0800 091 1514. It should only take 4 minutes and your feedback will help us make LOVEFiLM better in the future.Opening hours Mon to Sun 8am – 12am. If you’re on a mobile, or are unable to connect to freephone numbers, you can call on 020 8631 0020
>   4. Return all rental discs to us as soon as possible. We need to receive all discs before your billing date in order to avoid any further subscription fees being debited

And here's how it should be: 

  1. Click here to cancel your account.
  2. There is no step two.
Seriously Lovefilm? This was a real pain in the arse. You are a web-based company so why do I have to phone you just to cancel? Sort it out.
