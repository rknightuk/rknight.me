David Worthington's mum got an iPad, which just so happens to be her first computer. This is my favourite bit: 

> David: How about the iPad itself? Are there any particular apps you like or anything about it or how it works? Mom: Well, I like it when I can go just push the e-mail, and then it goes to it real fast. I don’t know if a computer does that or not ’cause I don’t have anything to compare it to.

This is why the iPad does so well; it's accessible to everyone, of all ages, all knowledge levels. The rest of the interview is fascinating.
