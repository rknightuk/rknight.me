![Portsmouth Logo](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-07-UoPportraitPUR300dpi.jpeg) As some of you may know, I'm starting Portsmouth Uni in September to study Web Technologies. As soon as I confirmed my place, I obviously did the first thing I always do when I have a vested interested in a new company or organisation: looked for online resources that they have such as Twitter, Facebook and information on their website. What I found was a plethora of Twitter accounts, Facebook fan pages and events, student-only websites, RSS feeds, a blog for new students as well as receiving various emails pointing me in the right direction.The my first stop was the uni website. This pointed me towards the university Twitter account, RSS feeds for news and events as well as a section crammed with information for new students. After following on Twitter for a few days, I also noticed they have separate Twitter accounts for the student union as well as the University magazine. Over the coming weeks I received emails with various information including how to find the dedicated Facebook group for the Technology department, login details for a first year student preparation website and a blog dedicated to providing information and answering any concerns. Talk about covering all your bases. I have to say, I don't know how other universities compare to this, but I am confident that Portsmouth Uni have got an excellent team working on all these different online elements and it only makes me want to start even sooner. Nice work, Portsmouth University. This is how it's done. P.S. I wanted to call this post "_Portsmouth Uni's got its shit together when it comes to social media_" but for obvious reasons, I didn't. For reference, here's a complete list of every resource they have that I have found so far. If I've missed anything, let me know in the comments. **Websites**
