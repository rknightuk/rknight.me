Colby Rabideau, on building for IE6 as a young developer:

> "It’s time to stop supporting IE6. No not because it isn’t standards compliant, or because the biggest companies on the web don’t think it’s economically feasible to continue to support archaic technology, or even because we would be doing our users a favor by forcing them to upgrade. No, it’s time because I don’t know how to build a web page that displays properly in IE6. I just don’t know how to IE6."

Same problem here. I've only ever used IE6 as a Firefox downloading application.
