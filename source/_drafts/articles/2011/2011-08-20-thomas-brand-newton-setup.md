Interview by Shawn Blanc with Thomas Brand, who uses his Apple Newton _every day_: 

> What I wouldn’t give for a modern carbon fiber encased Newton with a capacitive E Ink display, and even longer lasting battery. The iPhone can keep its multimedia capabilities, and all too-colorful app store. What I want is the modern equivalent to the reporter’s notepad. A true getting things done machine built for writers, planners, and creative people that is easy on the eyes and always connected to my greater body of work in the cloud. Then again, who am I kidding. I would settle for any Newton I could comfortably fit into my pants pocket.

Although I couldn't live without my iPhone, I do try and keep it pretty simple in terms of what I use for note-taking; [Elements](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/) is the only app I use on my iPhone for taking notes and I use [NVAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) on my Mac, syncing with Dropbox to keep everything together. But I do like the suggestion for a "_…modern equivalent to the reporter's notepad_". Gap in the market? Perhaps someone could repurpose those [surplus TouchPads](http://shawnblanc.net/2011-08-touchpad-ideas/).
