About a year ago [Cameron Banga](http://cameronbanga.com) was looking for a couple of technical reviewers for a book he was writing. I jumped at the chance to be part of the process and immediately told him I would do it. Fast forward to today when I received my print copy of the completed book in the post. I was excited not only to see the finished project, but also to see my name in a book that isn't "_Britain's Most Wanted Criminals_". ((I'm kidding. They never printed my name)) This post is a quick look at the book as well as my thoughts on being a technical reviewer for such a publication.

## Robb Lewis: Technical Reviewer

For those that might not be too sure (I wasn't at first), a technical reviewer's job is to read each chapter of the book and make comments and suggestions about how the chapter could be improved such as moving sections around or adding more screenshots (I love me some screenshots). Every week or so, I would be given a new chapter to read through, comment on and send back. Sometimes the deadline for these chapters would be a few days but sometimes the deadline would be less than a day. With university, my part time job and freelancing I sometimes had to rethink my priorities to meet the deadlines given but I always managed it (just about). I found the process of being a technical reviewer a lot of fun and had great support when needed from the team over at [Packt Publishing](http://packtpub.com) as well as regular updates from Cameron. I enjoyed the process so much I am now technical reviewer for two more upcoming books that Packt are working on (I have a chapter to read and review as soon as I've finished this post).

## The Book

Having been a reviewer for the book I have read iPhone User Interface Cookbook more times that any normal person would. The book is well presented, amazingly detailed and perfect for anyone looking specifically at the interface details of their iPhone or iPad application. The book looks into not only the basic UI, but also at notifications, pop-ups, sounds and migrating your apps to the iPad. The book is an indispensable resource for any developer. I will definitely be using it when I get around to developing an application (in the next 6 months, watch this space!).

It's great to see my name and bio printed in the front of the book as well as a thanks to me and the other reviewers from Cameron. I, in turn, would like to thank Cameron for allowing me the opportunity to be part of the process and wish him congratulations on his book.
