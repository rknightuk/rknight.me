![Cisco Tombstone](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011-04-tombstone.jpeg) Cisco [just announced](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Cisco-Restructures-Consumer-Business-NASDAQ-CSCO-1426209.htm) that they will be killing the Flip business for good. Why? According to Cisco to _"...realign the remaining consumer business"_. But why would they kill what is an essential name in the portable video camera market? Mobile phones.  I have, on many occasions, considered buying a Flip HD or similar product only to end up asking the same question to myself: _"When would I use it?"_. The answer, in actual fact, is all the time. But I already have an always available, always with me video camera: my iPhone. Okay, so my iPhone doesn't create the best video in the world but I'm not a videographer. I'm not making movies or feature length TV shows. I'm video my friends [smashing TVs](http://vimeo.com/12343226) and, well, [running about](http://vimeo.com/12343088). The quality of the video only has to be minimal to get the desired affect. "The best camera is the one you have with you". This applies to video cameras, too. If Cisco made a phone with awesome-as-all-hell camera packing Android, then they're in the right direction. But as it is, anyone with a half decent camera on their phone just doesn't _need_ a seperate video camera. And that's the problem; a single function device with its only function being something every smartphone can do just isn't going to cut it. Sorry, Flip. It's been fun.
