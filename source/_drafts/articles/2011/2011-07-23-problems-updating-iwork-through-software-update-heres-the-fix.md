If you've tried to update iWork '09 through software update and getting nothing, here could be the problem; if you've moved iWork out of the original folder, which would have been named _iWork '09_, software update will think it's not installed. Simple create a new folder, name it _iWork '09_ and put Numbers, Keynote and Pages in that folder. Then run software update and you should be prompted to install the Lion updates. Hope this helps.
