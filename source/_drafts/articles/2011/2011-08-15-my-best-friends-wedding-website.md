A few months ago, one of my best friends told me he was getting married in March. Being the geek that I am, my first thought wasn't about getting a new suit, buying them a present or even where I would stay after the reception (it's out of town); my first thought was "_Oooh wedding website_". I'd seen a few articles on the subject so I offered to create one for them, which also negated the need to buy them a gift1.

After a lengthy discussion and lots of Googling, myself and Ali (the groom) decided on the following pages:2

  * Home page, obviously
  * The Ceremony - Where it is, directions, map, photo
  * The Reception - As above
  * Events - Dates and locations of the stag and hen nights as well as the wedding and reception
  * The Day - An itinerary of the entire day, available as a calendar download
  * Travel and accommodation - These pages are pretty self explanatory
  * The Bridal Party - Photos and names of all those in the bridal party (Best man, Maid of Honour, Ushers and Bridesmaids)
  * Contact

Between us we also decided that things like a guestbook and online RSVP would be no good as <s>a large majority of the guests</s> the older family members wouldn't use these as features. A couple of the online-specific features we did implement were a song request form and a countdown timer through some simple PHP code.

The website is mobile browser compatible through media queries along with a custom icon when saving to an iPhone/iPad home screen. I also created email addresses for the bride and groom for those who need to get in contact with the couple: _thegroom@example.com_

And there were a couple of final touches: I used a couple of fonts ([Lobster Two](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lobster+Two) and [Nixie One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Nixie+One)) from the [Google font directory](http://www.google.com/webfonts) as well as creating a print stylesheet for the site.3

As far as the final product goes, I'm fairly happy. As a student web developer, projects like this give me an outlet to practice my somewhat limited (at the moment) skills and in my honest opinion, I believe that in the next three to four years, wedding websites will be a staple of any ceremony.

1I will still buy them a gift, I'm kidding. Honestly.  
2Other pages considered were 'Our story', 'Photos' which was not needed due to the power of Facebook and 'Gifts' again, unnecessary as they weren't asking for gifts.  
3Every time you don't use a print stylesheet when creating a website, a unicorn dies.
