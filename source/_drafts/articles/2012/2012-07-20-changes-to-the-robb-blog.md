I have made a few changes to the site in the last couple of days. Firstly, and most obvious, is the site redesign. Cleaner, more modern, I like it. Secondly, I now have link posts. There has been a lot of debate about whether link posts are a good or bad thing but I fall in the “good” argument. So they’re here. Finally, I have stopped auto-tweeting to my personal account and now have a dedicated account for the site: [@TheRobbBlog](http://twitter.com/therobbblog). This account will have all stories and links from the site automatically tweeted as they are posted. All of this is part of a big push to make myself post more and basically [show up every day](http://shawnblanc.net/2012-07-50-things/).
