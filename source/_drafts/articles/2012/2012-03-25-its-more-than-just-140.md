> I am in the lucky few that gets to use twitter in this way. I am in the lucky few that gets their questions answered by a bunch of genii and also that I have made such excellent friends who have given me access to some incredible opportunities over the last couple of years.

Amen to that. I use Twitter for the same reasons; as much as I love my friends, most do not have any interest in retina displays, Wordpress plugins and web development. Twitter allows me to speak to people with all manner of interests.
