Earlier today [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/rmlewisuk/status/182102254269116416) that once my student loan comes in, I'm going to buy Patrick Rhone's [new book, Enough](http://www.enoughbook.com/). Then something happened that was, quite frankly, the highlight of my day; Patrick tweeted me back telling me to drop him an email to sort out a student discount. Sweet. Then I thought about what he was offering me out of the kindness of his heart. A discount on a book that, by all accounts is fantastic, and costs less than what I earn in an hour at my part time job. Something Patrick has worked hard on, something that I want and something that will (hopefully) give me hours of pleasure. I politely declined Patrick's offer of a discount and rather offer this post as a thank you to him for being a truly awesome guy and making my day. You can find about Enough on the book's [dedicated website](http://www.enoughbook.com/). Go buy it.
