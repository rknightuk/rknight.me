[According to Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/small_business/2012-07-amazon_same_day_delivery_how_the_e_commerce_giant_will_destroy_local_retail_.single.html): 

> Now that it has agreed to collect sales taxes, the company can legally set up warehouses right inside some of the largest metropolitan areas in the nation. Why would it want to do that? Because Amazon’s new goal is to get stuff to you immediately—as soon as a few hours after you hit Buy.

This would be a huge shift for online retail, and would basically kill local high street retailers. If this comes to the UK, I might never leave the house again.
