**Timeline feels crowded**

If anyone you follows mentions someone else (even if you don’t follow them), you see it in your timeline. Hopefully there will be an option for tweaking this in the future.

**Global stream is awesome**

As it stands, the global stream is totally readable and also a huge time waster for me. I get lost just looking through the global stream to watch for new conversations and the obligitory “Finally on the alpha. Hello App.net” posts. Although as I [said last night](https://alpha.app.net/rmlewisuk/post/115687) the global stream isn’t sustainable:

> There is no way the global stream can continue be to be useable if App.net takes off in the way that (presumably) is wanted by the founders.

**Mobile is really important**

I’ve tried a few App.net webapps namely [shrtmsg](http://shrtmsg.com) and [Appeio](http://appeio.com) and although these are pretty good, I need a native iOS client to really make the most of the service. I’m using [Ch.eer.io](http://ch.eer.io) for notifications of mentions so at least I have push notifications. There are, of course, many iOS apps in the works but with everyone vying for a place on the betas, I may be waiting a while.

**The money**

As it stands, I’m more than happy with what I got for my $50, but in a years time am I going to want to pay again? And moreover, how many people do they need to become a sustainable business? 100,000? 200,000? I’m not sure I believe there is enough people willing to part with $50 a year, even if Twitter is going in an unfavourable direction.

Overall, I really like App.net. There are some problems, but this is an alpha not a fully-fledged product yet. Time will tell if they can get enough users to make it worth their while.
