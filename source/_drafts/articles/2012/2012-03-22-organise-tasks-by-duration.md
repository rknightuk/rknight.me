Every since I've had my iPhone, I have tried all manner of different todo apps and none of them really worked for me until [Clear](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/clear/) was released. Because of the simple interface and speedy input of tasks, this app is perfect for how I like to manage tasks. The problem I cam across was how I had sorted my tasks into different lists. I had things like _uni work, personal, development work_ and so on. And this just didn't work because I would go into the app, look at one list and only do things from there. There was no real way for me to see what I would be able to accomplish in the time I had. So for the past week I've been using a new listing system I thought of: duration of tasks.  ![Clear](http://therobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012-03-clear.png) Every task I have is now allocated into one of four lists: ((The other lists are there because it's so easy to input data into Clear and the speed of input is hugely faster than any iOS text editor.)) 

  * Deadlined - This list is for things I need to do by a specific date such as coursework or freelance work. This list gets looked at every time I look for tasks to do.
  * Less than an hour - Anything that will only take a few minutes to do such as making a phone call, sending an email and other miscellany.
  * Less than three hours - For tasks that will take a bit longer and require more attention.
  * More than three hours - Everything else. This has been the home of "_Redesign blog_" for the past week. I will get round to it.
Using this system, I can easily choose a task based on the amount of time I have, or feel I want to dedicate to it. These exact categories may not work perfectly for you so play around with different timings/categories and see if you can increase the amount of tasks you can get done.
