excerpt: "I visited New York for Christmas and New Year. Here are a few recommendations for place to visit, eat and drink"
---

I visited my friend over Christmas who is currently working in New York. I had an amazing time and I thought I would recommend some places I visited for anyone who is planning on visiting in the future, as well as to keep a record of what I got up to.

### Restaurants

We ate at quite a few restaurants and these three are the ones I would recommend to anyone:

- [Rogue](http://roguenyc.com) - Rogue is a sports bar but the food is absolutely fantastic. As long as you can put up with all the sports (I counted seven simultaneous games on one occasion) being shown on their 14+ televisions, it's well worth a visit. 
- [Ruby Tuesday, Times Square](http://www.rubytuesday.com/) - Ruby Tuesday is exactly what you'd expect from an American restaurant; huge portions, lots of meat and amazing buffalo chicken.
- [Bella Napoli, 7th Avenue](http://bellanapoli.com/) - An excellent Italian restaurant, great service and reasonably priced.

### Attractions

Ignoring the obvious, well-known attractions such as Times Square and the Empire State Building, [the High Line](http://thehighline.org) was a personal highlight. The High Line is *"a public park built on an historic freight rail line elevated above the streets on Manhattan’s West Side"* and definitely makes a nice change of pace from barging past people on the streets. We took a ride on the [Circleline Downtown Cruise](http://www.circlelinedowntown.com/) which gives great views of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline as well as Ellis Island and Governor's Island. We also did a helicoptor tour which gave spectacular views, but it is a little on the pricy side (~£100 p/person for 15 minutes). And I turned into a little kid when I visited the [Nintendo Store](http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/) at the Rockefeller Center.

### Photos

[Ed](http://edpoole.me) was kind enough to lend me his Canon 650D to take photos which was an interesting experience. Apparently, a good camera *doesn't* make you a good photographer. I got used to it after a couple of days and managed to get a few nice photos which I have [posted on Exposure](https://rmlewisuk.exposure.so/new-york-2013).
