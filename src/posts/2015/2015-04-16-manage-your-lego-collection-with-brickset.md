[Brickset](http://brickset.com/), as well as being a great source for LEGO news and reviews, is a also an excellent service for keeping a list of all the sets and minifigures that you own. Brickset also has some more advanced features for marking sets that you own without minifigures and custom flags to make managing your collection even easier. Once you've set up your collection, you can also share it publicly if you desire. For example, [here is my collection](http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-rmlewisuk). If you haven't already, [signup for a Brickset account](http://brickset.com/signup).

## Sets
There are a number of different ways you can search for sets to add them to your collection: by set number, by set name or by tag. To add a set to your collection, type the set name or number into the search box and once you've found the set you want to add, simply check the "I own" checkbox and it will be added to your collection. A large number of sets on Brickset are also tagged to make searching for a set easier; if you type `Emmet` into the search box you will see `Emmet Brickowski [Tag]` as one of the suggestions. Selecting this option will show you [all sets that contain an Emmet minifigure](http://brickset.com/sets/tag-Emmet-Brickowski). You can then view a list of all the sets you by selecting `Sets you own` from the `My sets` menu. You can also set up a wanted list of sets by checking the `I want` checkbox: your wanted list can be found by selecting `Sets you want` from the `My sets` menu.

Once you've added a set, you will also be able to view a list of all the minifigures you own by going to [brickset.com/minifigs/mycollection-owned](http://brickset.com/minifigs/mycollection-owned). Brickset will automatically work out which minifigures you have based on the sets you own. However, if you're like me, you may on occasion buy a set without the minifigures and Brickset has a feature to cope with this: flags.

### Custom Flags and No Minifigures

Flags are a way for you to add extra metadata to the sets you own. To set up flags, go to [brickset.com/mycollection](http://brickset.com/mycollection) and select `Set up flags`. Brickset allows you up to four custom flags: I have a `Bricklinked` flag for noting when I bought the parts of a set from [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/), a `To build` flag to note when I haven't yet opened a set and a `Maybe` flag to use in conjunction with my wanted list. The blue flag has an extra checkbox to make the flag indicate that you don't own the minifigures for a set. By using this flag, Brickset will not show that you own the minifigures from any set with this flag applied.

## Loose Minifigures

If you have purchased a minifigure individually, there are two ways you can add this to your minifigures collection. The first is to find the set the minifigure comes from, select the `minifigures` tab from the set page, and check the `I own` checkbox. These will be added to your minifigure collection. The second method is to search by the name of the minifigure: simply change the search dropdown to `minifigs`. Once you have found the minifigure you want to add to your collection, simple check the  `I own` checkbox.

## Custom lists

Once you've set up your collection, you can filter by theme, year and sort it by various different methods (e.g. number of pieces). This is great for sets that are directly linked together by something official like a theme, but if you want to create a custom list  of sets, or BrickLists as Brickset calls them, you can. For example, I've made [a list of the sets given away with the Daily Mail last year](http://brickset.com/sets/list-12524) for my own reference. To create a new BrickList, select `BrickLists` from `My Menu` and then select ` Create new BrickList`. Give your list a title and description and then you can start adding sets to it. You can choose to make it public or keep it private.

## Find out if you own a specific part

As an additional bonus of having catalogued your collection, if you are looking for a specific part, Brickset will tell you which sets that you own contain that part you are looking for. Change the search dropdown to `part`, find the part you want to find, choose a colour and then select `View sets in your collection that contain this part`.

## Collection Summary

Now you've added all your sets and minifigures, you can view your collection summary by selecting `Collection summary` from the `My Sets` menu. This summary will show you, by theme, the total cost of the sets you own, the total numbers of sets in a theme and how many of them you own as well as a number of other data points. Fair warning: if you don't want to know how much you've spent on LEGO, avoid this page.
