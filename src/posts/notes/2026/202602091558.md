Probably a good time to post this guide from @adam@social.lol outlining how to [host your own IRC server](https://www.neatnik.net/setting-up-an-irc-server/)

@zicklepop@nyan.lol also has some info on doing it [with Coolify and Traefik](https://melkat.blog/p/hosting-an-irc-server-with-traefik-and-coolify/)
