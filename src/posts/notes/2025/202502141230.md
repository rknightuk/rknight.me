I just updated @echofeed@hub.7622.me to support the character limit of the fediverse server instead of the standard 500. Ran the numbers to see what limits people set and as expected its a handful of @gotosocial@gts.superseriousbusiness.org servers @ 5000 characters, a couple of Friendica servers @ 20k, but mostly Mastodon @ 500.
