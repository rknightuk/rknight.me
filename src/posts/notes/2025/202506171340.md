I've look before but worth a try again. Is there a podcast app for iOS that has:

- A sanctioned API for getting listen history, current shows, etc (PocketCasts has one but also not really)
- OR a host-your-own backend with a companion app

Does something Plex-like have podcast functionality perhaps?
