The thing a lot of companies seem to miss about their April Fools "jokes" is if you want it to be enjoyed (and maybe even warrant a slight laugh from someone), it needs to be something people are a bit disappointed about when they realise it doesn't actually exist.

Posting on facebook "from today a monkey is going to do all the deliveries for us hehe april fools" is just stupid.
