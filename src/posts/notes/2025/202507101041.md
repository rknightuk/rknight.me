![A set of feedback buttons asking if you're happy or not happy. The happy one is broken](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/feedback-buttons.jpg)

I’ve walked past this set of feedback buttons a few times in my local home bargains and I finally snapped a photo of it because I can’t stop thinking about it. 

Who is looking at this feedback? If someone says they’re unhappy, there’s no mechanism to give any additional information. How does a binary happy or not happy help them improve? How did the happy button get broken? Perhaps someone just have a fucking great time in Home Bargains and hulked it so hard it retreated into the wall. It’s been like this for months. The person in head office who’s job it is to check out this feedback must be frantic that this particular stores isn’t collecting their customer sat numbers.
