Ordered a MacBook (my first one actually owned by me in a long time) so of course I had to order a sleeve for it then I ended up ordering the MOFT stand which @johnvoorhees@macstories.net [reviewed here](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/now-you-see-it-now-you-dont-a-review-of-the-moft-invisible-stand/) and also the sleeve was [the one John has](https://www.tomtoc.com/products/defender-a13-laptop-sleeve-kit-for-14-inch-macbook-pro-%E5%A4%8D%E5%88%B6).

Basically, listen to John is the advice.
