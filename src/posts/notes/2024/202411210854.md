#BabyKnight has been my alarm clock for months but this morning she decided to sleep in until five minutes before we had to leave. Mad rush to get out the house, I didn't notice it was starting to snow/sleet so didn't take my coat. Walking back from dropping her off at nursery my face was pummelled by sleet and felt like it was going to freeze entirely off.
