1. Lockscreen - Calendar events, missed calls, sms. Android has it, WebOS has it, Symbian has it. Even Windows Mobile has it. Sort it out.
2. Notification management - One notification at a time really doesn’t cut it when I’ve got messages, emails, facebook, twitter, reminders.
3. Better organisation of apps - I don’t know about everyone else, but I am so bored of having to scroll through to find an app. Folders perhaps?
4. Landscape orientation… - … for EVERYTHING. Springboard, App Store, iTunes, Settings. EVERYTHING.
5. Wireless syncing - Why wouldn’t I want this? Walk into my house, have something to eat and it’s done.
6. Background apps - Although this is isn’t something I would use all the time, it should still be available when I do want it
