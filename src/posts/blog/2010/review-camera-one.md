### Overview

When it comes to camera features, the iPhone's is severely lacking. No zoom, no timer, no effects. But there are loads of different apps that give you this functionality, but most only offer one or two extra features. Camera One offers them all. Self timer, tap to focus, zoom, grid view and voice shutter are just a few of Camera One's features. But would you be better off getting a couple of dedicated apps thinking about quality over quantity? Let's find out.

### Features


- Tap to focus (3GS only) 
- Big shutter button 
- 4x Digital zoom 
- Colour effects 
- Self timer 
- Anti shake 
- Voice shutter 
- Timestamping 
- Grid view 
- Save directly to camera roll 
- Email photos 

The main screen of Camera One shows the shutter button, camera roll access button and a navigation bar across the top for turning different features on and off. As default digital zoom is turned on and this is shown with a slider bar above the shutter button. Zoom is just one of the features of Camera One and as the name 'ALL-IN-1' suggests, Camera One has pretty much every feature you could ever want, so lets see what else is on offer. Each feature has its own icon on the top navigation bar, the first of which is the zoom. The next is the 'flash' function. This is supposed to improve photos taken in low light but I really couldn't see any difference in the photos dispute what the screenshots on the app store show. There are two colour effects available which can be toggled from the paint tube icon; black and white, and sepia, although the effect isn't shown whilst taking the photo, only once it has been saved.

Self timer is something that many camera apps offer and Camera One is no different; you can choose a 2, 5 or 10 second delay before a photo is taken (although how anyone is managing to balance their iPhone to use self timer is beyond me). For those who find the iPhone's default camera button to be a bit small and difficult to use efficiently, the big button option in Camera One might help. Enabling this allows you to press anywhere on the screen to take a photo. Blur is the curse of any photo. With Camera One's anti-shake feature the likelihood of blurry photos is greatly reduced. With anti-shake turned on, a photo won't be taken until the camera is steady. This is indicated by coloured lines either side of the shutter button, which will disappear once the iPhone is perfectly still. Once of the best features about Camera One is the voice shutter. Enable this option, press the shutter button and a photo will be taken when the app registers a certain level of noise (say cheese!). Camera One also offers a grid view which shows an indicator of the centre of the photo for capturing subjects in perfect position. Other features include the ability to email photos, adding timestamps to photos, choosing the output size and tapping to focus on a specific area (3GS only).

### The Breakdown

#### The Good

"You only need Camera One" is the claim on the splash screen and this is definitely true. Camera One has every feature of every other camera app all rolled into one. Features can easily be toggled on and off and loading times are quick enough for this to be used as a replacement to the iPhone's standard camera app. Sharing photos is quick and easy with the built-in email function and you can also view photos at full resolution rather than scaled to fit the iPhone screen. 

#### The Bad

Camera One offers the most features of any camera app but I find the interface lacks polish. Trying to work out which icons correspond to which feature can be difficult and but there is an explanation of each function in the help section of the settings. The other issue I have is with the 'flash' function. In various different light conditions I couldn't see any improvement in the photos. This is disappointing seeing as the iPhone doesn't have a flash, and if this worked, it would be invaluable.

### The Verdict

If you feel, like most of us do, that the iPhone's camera app just doesn't cut it then you'd be smart to spend your money on Camera One rather than loads of different single-function apps. Despite some of the issues I've mentioned, Camera One offers everything you could need to take the perfect picture and for $0.99 this app is more than a bargain.
