### Overview

So you're browsing the Internet at work, college or on the bus and you see a long article or review you'd like to read later. What do you do? Email it to yourself? Bookmark it? Why not convert it to an easier to read format and have a look whenever you're ready? That is exactly what Instapaper Pro does. It allows you do save articles to for access later from the Instapaper website or the iPhone and iPad app. Simply add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks in your browser on your computer or mobile Safari and you're ready to go.

### Features

To get started with Instapaper, you first need to create an account. This can either be done in the app, or on the Instapaper website. Once this is done, you need to start adding articles. Articles can be manually added, or added with the bookmarklet. To add the bookmarklet to Safari, go to settings in the app and choose 'install bookmarklet' and follow the instructions. Now whenever you find an article you want to save for later, simply select the bookmarklet from your bookmarks. So now you've added some articles you want to read them, right? Simply press the sync button in the bottom left and all your saved articles will be downloaded to the app. Select an article to read and you will be presented with a stripped down version of the article you saved. Ads, sidebars and other stuff you don't need is taken away, leaving you just the text and images that are relevant.

There are three different methods to navigate through an article; scrolling, pagination and tilt scroll. Scrolling is self explanatory. Pagination allows you to tap the top of an article to go up and the bottom to go down. Tilt scroll (my favourite of the three) lets you tilt your iPhone back and forth to navigate through the article. A quick note on pagination and tilt scroll; you can only have one or the other turned on and not both. When looking at a saved article, you can resize and reformat the text to make it more readable. Options available include font style, two different sizes as well the ability to change the spacing and width of an article. Saved articles can be emailed or share to Twitter and Tumblr. This can either be done through the Instapaper app, or links can be sent directly to the official Tumblr app and, everyone's favourite Twitter app, Tweetie. Sharing can be accessed through the arrow icon in the bottom right which also houses the ability to open the article in the in built browser or Safari. Other feature include swipe to archive, create folders for articles, star articles and a choice of a light or dark interface. All these options can be accessed from the settings page from the main menu. Articles can be send to Instapaper from many Twitter, RSS reader and news apps available in the app store; a list of which is available on the Instapaper website.

### The Breakdown

#### The Good

Instapaper Pro gives users plenty of options for all aspects of reading articles; navigation, saving and sharing. All options are easily accessible and make perfect sense in terms of where they are located. The in app browser is great for looking at saved articles that couldn't be converted (this happens on a small minority of articles) and the browser gives you the option to see the text-based article or see the original web page. The installation is as easy as it could possibly be, despite the restrictions of Safari when trying to save bookmarklets.

#### The Bad

The design of Instapaper seems a little less polished than some other apps and the 'open in Safari' button takes an extra button press than is necessary. However, this doesn't detract from the usability of the app.

### The Verdict

Instapaper Pro is the perfect companion for anyone who spends a lot of time reading articles online. The app is always being improved and the developer works hard to improve through user feedback. The app is a universal app so will work on your iPad as well with all the same features of the iPhone version and then some iPad-specific extras. If you're still not convinced a free version is available in the app store so you can check it out before you buy the full pro version.
