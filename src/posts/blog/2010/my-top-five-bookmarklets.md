For those who don’t know, a bookmarklet is basically a bookmark that will add one-click functionality to a webpage such as showing only the text of an article or emailing a link. Below are my top 5 bookmarklets.

1. Instapaper: Read Later - Instapaper allows you to save a webpage to your account for reading at a later date through instapaper.com or on your mobile. This bookmarklet adds the page you are currently looking at to your Instapaper account. There is also an Instapaper iPhone app, which is awesome.
2. Print What You Like - This service allows you to remove elements of a page to “Save money. Save the environment”, or so they say. I use it to archive reviews I do to PDF, without saving all the adverts and comments.
3. Readability - On a website full of adverts and flashing nonsense? Use this bookmarklet to strip all the crap out and just see the content. You can change choose different font styles and font sizes before you install it as well. Instapaper has a similar bookmarklet, but I prefer the options on Readability.
4. Gmail This - The name is a dead giveaway as to what this one does. Opens a new compose window of Gmail, with the title and URL of the page you’re looking at. Only works if you use Gmail, obviously.
5. Bit.ly Sidebar - For shorten URLs, bit.ly is by far my favourite. This bookmarklet opens a sidebar and shortens the URL for you. From the sidebar you can see links to the same page on Twitter and post links to Twitter.
