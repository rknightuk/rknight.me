Apple are announcing 4.0 on Thursday and I wanted to update my list of stuff I wanted. Here is what I wrote [back in January](/blog/6-things-i-want-in-os4/index.html) (in italics) and what I’ve changed (in bold);

_1. Lockscreen - Calendar events, missed calls, sms. Android has it, WebOS has it, Symbian has it. Even Windows Mobile has it. Sort it out. -_ **Just calendar events, messages, emails and missed calls would do the trick - please?**

_2. Notification management - One notification at a time really doesn’t cut it when I’ve got messages, emails, facebook, twitter, reminders. -_ **Too many notifications, no way of see any more than one. I reckon this’ll happen.**

_3. Better organisation of apps - I don’t know about everyone else, but I am so bored of having to scroll through to find an app. Folders perhaps? -_ **This needs to happen. Too. Many. Apps.**

_4. Landscape orientation… - … for EVERYTHING. Springboard, App Store, iTunes, Settings. EVERYTHING. -_ **Very possible seeing as the iPad can do it.**

_5. Wireless syncing - Why wouldn’t I want this? Walk into my house, have something to eat and it’s done. -_ **I WANT this, but I don’t think we’ll get it.**

_6. Background apps - Although this is isn’t something I would use all the time, it should still be available when I do want it. -_ **Rumours have been flying round about an Exposé-style treatment. This is probably what we’ll get.** 

**7. More customisation - Background wallpapers will likely happen as the iPad has it. But what about custom message, mail and voicemail tones.**

Bonus item - **For goodness sake, let turn off fucking cover flow. Please.**
