Four in a Row Pro is the classic game of Connect 4, rehashed for the iPhone. Playing the game is a pleasure, the interface is clean and well thought out and the game is very responsive. You can play either by yourself against the iPhone, or against a friend (although passing the phone back and forth can become tedious). There is also a demo that will play through a game, for those who don’t know the rules (anyone?) [Maybe if you've been living under a large rock your whole life? - Editor]

Playing the game is easy, click where you want to drop your token, the computer follows and so on. The sound effects are turned off as default which is a good thing, because as well thought out as the sounds are, after one or two games they will start to drive you mad.

There are three difficulty settings for playing against your iPhone: Easy, medium and hard. Easy, is as the title suggests, easy. I beat the iPhone every time, and I was pretty pleased with myself. That was until I moved onto medium. Even on medium I struggled to get anywhere close to beating the iPhone and on hard I still haven’t beaten it. Another great thing about this game is the ‘classic interface’ option, changing the menu and game board into a more minimal interface (screenshot below). This is a nice touch that so many apps don’t include.

Four in a Row Pro also has an ad supported free version, but when something is as good as this, I always feel it is worth buying and supporting. This is one of those games that you will end up going to when you’ve got a couple of spare minutes and, for me at least, that is exactly what I want from a game on my iPhone. An excellent addition to any app collection - 9.5 out of 10.
