Finding a game in the AppStore is easy. Finding one that is well produced, fun and addictive is harder but Droplitz is one of those games.
The idea of Droplitz is this; Get the droplitz (silver balls) from the top down to the bottom. This might sound easy, but there are two places the droplitz come from, so you are trying to control two seperate paths at any one time. The droplitz multiply once they get to a split in their path, so by the time they get to the bottom of the board, you could have anything up to about 8, all from the original one.

The game features three modes: Normal, hardcore and infinite. Normal is as the name suggests, the standard game for beginners. Hardcore mode is for more advanced players (or people who think they’re too good for normal, like I did, and lost. Badly). Infinite is a practice mode. As you can see from my above screenshot, I’m not very good at it!

You can toggle sounds and effects on/off in the settings, and to my surprise, these don’t become annoying like some other games. The music and effects are well thought out, and add depth to the game play. Also within the settings are three themes to choose from, none of which make any difference to the game, so it’s just personal preference. They is also a simple ‘how to play’ section, but I recommend just jumping straight into it.
This game is excellent, and has earned a permanent place on my iPhone, and also earned 9.8 out of 10.
