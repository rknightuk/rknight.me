Small things amuse small minds. Same applies to simple things. Stupid Cloud is simple in terms of graphics as well as gameplay, but is amazingly addictive.

In Stupid Cloud, a cloud (who is presumably stupid) drops various items from suns to gherkins for you to collect. You collect them by moving your funny little character called Mr Nom Nom left and right by tiliting the iPhone. You get three lives and every item you drop, you lose a life. Mr Nom Nom makes chomping sounds each time he catchs an item and you must get as high a score as possible, in order to submit it to the global highscores.

The highscores are powered by Scoreloop, and signing up is as easy as typing a username in the pop-up box. I’m not sure if Stupid Cloud was designed for kids, but the graphics are in a sort of crayon-drawn style. I don’t care if it’s for kids or not, this game is addictive as hell, and is well worth the money.
