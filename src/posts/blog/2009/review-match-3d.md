Match 3D Flick Puzzle is a new twist on an old game with really nice graphics.

In most ‘create rows of blocks to get rid of them’ style games, you have one board to play on. In Match 3D you are playing on a cube which you can move about to choose which side you want to work with. Match 3D requires you to create rows of three or more identical blocks to make them disappear by swapping the places of blocks that are next to each other.

The game itself doesn’t exactly sound like it’s breaking new ground, but, as I said, you are playing on a cube rather than a 2D surface, which obviously gives you six surfaces to move around rather than just the one. There are various different icons to match up from the little green Match 3D mascot, to sunbursts and rockets. Personally, I find the blocks a little bit too small as standard but there is a great zoom feature which is a great help.

Starting a new games gives you a huge amount of options to choose from such as no locked blocks, no clear blocks as well as other options. This gives Match 3D a massive amount of variations and potentially unlimited levels and gameplay. The music is well produced (although as with most iPhone games, the music will get tedious eventually) and you can also play your own music whilst playing.

At $3.99 Match 3D Flick Puzzle is slightly more expensive than other games in the app store, but if you enjoy puzzle games, this is one of the best I have played.
