On a routine family holiday, two siblings, Calvin and Cassie, discovered a pair of ordinary looking propeller hats inside a small cave. Naturally, they put on the hats and soon realized that they were able to control flight with their thoughts! This was the dawn of the copter kids! This is the premise for Copter Kid.

In Copter Kid you must fly your character across the screen collecting shields and avoiding as many enemies as you can. You can play as either Calvin or Cassie, although as far as I can tell, this is choice is purely aesthetic and doesn’t affect the gameplay in any way.

Pressing on the screen will make your character go higher and releasing will make them drop lower. You need to avoid aeroplanes, airships and spaceships, who are trying to retrieve the copter hats back, in order to progress through the game. If you hit any of these, you will get put to the start of the level. As you complete each level, the difficulty increases. You can upload your scores to the global scoreboard as well as use Facebook connect to show your scores to your friends. The graphics and animation are beautiful (check out the look on the Copter Kids faces when they hit something, hilarious!) and the music is surprisingly catchy.

I really like this game. It’s easy to learn, difficult to master, but a huge amount of fun to play. And the $0.99 price tag won’t stretch your wallet too much.
