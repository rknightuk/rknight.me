I never played marbles as a kid. Carrying a pocket full of the things really didn’t appeal to me, and to be honest, computers were far more interesting. After playing Marbles for iPhone, I sort of wish I had played it in real life.

The main aim of marbles is to knock your opponents marbles out of the circle. Tilting the iPhone will move your angle around the circle, and flicking the screen will shoot. If you knock an opponents marble out the circle, you get another go and so on until you don’t knock any out. Your opponent will then take their turn to knock your marbles out. Each marble you get out the circle, earns you a point.

Play Marbles uses a beautiful 3D interface for gameplay and menus. In single player, you can play a quick game, play in a tournament, a league, as well as a career mode. There are loads of different levels to play on including a playroom and a tv studio, although these don’t actually make a difference to gameplay, it’s nice to have a choice.

Loading and going through the menus seems a little bit slow, even on my 3GS, but it is still perfectly usable. Another nice feature is the ability to put your face, or someone elses, onto your marbles. Just select the camera button and you can take a photo of your mug to appear on the marble.

Apart from the slightly laggy menus, Play Marbles is an excellent game that will give you hours of fun.
