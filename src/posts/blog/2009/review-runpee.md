When you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go, right? What if you’re watching a movie? If you’re at home you can just pause it. But what if you’re at the cinema? What if you miss something important? That’s where RunPee comes in.
Some of you may have heard of, or even used, RunPee.com, a database of the best time to go when nature calls during a movie. The iPhone app works exactly the same way as the website (albeit with a reduced list of movies).

When you open RunPee you are presented with a list of current movies which can be sorted by release date, or by name. At the time of writing, 23 current movies were show, with three of those missing the all important RunPee time (presumably waiting for someone to submit the best times to RunPee). I checked my local cinema listings, to see if all the movies showing were in the RunPee app, and they were, so for me at least, the app covered anything I could have gone to see. Your mileage may vary depending on your region, as well as the amount of movies your local cinema shows.

Selecting the movie you want to know about, the RunPee moments are shown (I chose Angels and Demons as an example). In Angels and Demons there are two moments that are best to go; one at 35 minutes in, and one at 70 minutes. RunPee tells you how long you have before you need to be back (2 minutes and 3 minutes respectively in this case), a quick synopsis of what you will miss, as well as timer button which you should start at the beginning of the movie, so you know how far in you are. In terms of the synopsis, I can see an immediate problem - spoilers. The synopsis isn’t hidden until you need it, so if needed to go, and found the movie you were watching, you already know what you’ll miss.

The interface is clean and easy to use but I think it’s a shame there isn’t a function to search through the entire RunPee database. Also the spoiler problem would probably put me off using it. Furthermore, there is no offline option so you must have network coverage to use the app. If these things were fixed, RunPee could be a great app, but as it is, it’s only marginally useful.
