There are thousands of iPhone games in the app store that are designed for one player. But if you want a game for parties and family gatherings, Word Kinshi is the way to go.
The rules of Word Kinshi will be familiar to anyone who has played taboo or a similar word game; get your team mates to guess the word on the card, without saying any of the ‘kinshi’ (Japenese for forbidden) words. Try to guess as many of the words as possible within the time limit, then move it’s the other teams go. The team who guesses the highest amount of words, wins the game.

Word Kinshi is designed as simply as the rules. You have two options on the main menu - ‘How to play’ and ‘Start Game’. How to play gives you an easy to understand run down of the rules, just in case anyone playing isn’t familiar with the game and start game is self explanatory.
Once a game is started, the timer starts counting down from 1 minute down to zero. If a word is guessed correctly, pressing the tick adds one to the current teams score. A team can pass on a word by pressing the ‘x’ but they will lose a point. Once the time gets to zero, the next team can have their turn. Each team can have as many turns as they like, and the running total is shown at the bottom of the screen.

I don’t know how big the word catalogue is, but I played through the game a few times, and didn’t notice any repeated words. The graphics for the game are excellent and obviously a lot of thought went into them. However, there are a couple of things I would like to see added to the game. Firstly, the ability to choose more than 2 teams would be a really useful addition. Secondly, when you exit the game, it would be good if scores were saved, so you could take a break without leaving the game open on your iPhone.

I absolutely love this game and I think everyone should go and buy it right now. If you need a quick and fun game for parties, this is definitely the way to go.
