RSS is one of the best and easiest ways to get up-to-date news fast. So when I purchased my iPhone 3GS last week, I need to find an application that could do 2 things.

1. Sync with Google Reader. I love the full browser version of Google Reader, so I still want to use it when I’m at home.
2. ReadItLater integration. By far the easiest way to keep track of things I want to read, but not keep permanently.

After looking around for quite a while I finally decided to purchase Feeds by Prime31. I was instantly impressed.

When I first opened Feeds I was prompted for my Google email and password, and after inputting these, my feeds were imported. So that was number 1 ticked off.

To find the ReadItLater options, I had to go to the iPhone settings, which is where the Feeds settings are changed, as opposed to in-app preferences. Plenty of options here, including a choice of 4 colour themes, which is nice. After finding the ReadItLater settings, I went back into Feeds to check this function out. Once you’re reading an item, clicking ‘feed actions’ bring up a few actions including share the article, adding tags, Instapaper article, email article, and ReadItLater. This worked flawlessly, and I went straight into RIL to check if it had been added, and it had.

Feeds completely fulfilled my objectives, and was well worth the money. Overall I give Feeds 9.5 out of 10.
