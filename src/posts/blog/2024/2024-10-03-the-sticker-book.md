Me every time I open a drawer at my desk:

> Wow I have a lot of stickers in this drawer that I've never used because I'm paralysed with choice about where to put them and if I get it wrong there's no going back

No more! I have freed myself from the shackles of sticker doubt by sticking them in a book. An extraordinary idea to stick my stickers in a thing sort of designed for stickers. The scope of my genius literally knows no bounds.

_But what if the book is the wrong place for them, what if there's a better place to put them? WHAT THEN?!_
