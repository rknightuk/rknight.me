WeblogPoMo is over. You can [read all my posts here](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/weblogpomo/). I followed [the hashtag](https://social.lol/tags/weblogpomo) all month and also followed the [@pomo](https://beep.town/@pomo) account. I was flooded with excellent posts daily including people who just started blogging which fills my small web heart with joy.

There's nothing I love more than reading about things people are _really_ into and WeblogPoMo has delivered on that. Here's some of the stuff I enjoyed. Anne organised all this and you can see [all her excellent posts here](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/tag/weblogpomo2024).

### Stats

I now have no post drafts or ideas left in Obsidian so don't expect another post for a while but I did it. Every single day in May, including one double posting day.

I wrote **32 posts** containing **~14000 words** and **21 code samples**. As of this writing, the [@pomo bot](https://beep.town/@pomo) has posted **1131 times** so even ignoring some duplicates becuase of a bug in [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app), that's a hell of lot of posts.

### My Favourite Posts

This wasn't technically part of WeblogPoMo but it's glorious so I'm putting it here anyway: [The Bum Gun by Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/the-bum-gun).

### My Most Popular Posts

Here are my most popular posts for the month based on [my analytics](https://app.usefathom.com/share/isejuyjy/rknight.me?comparison=none&page=1&range=last_30_days&sort=visitors%3Adesc). Keep in mind these will be skewed by length of time up so the earlier posts likely have more views.

#### [7622](https://rknight.me/blog/7622/)

This one took off _way_ more than I thought it would. Turns out people were really interested in the extra B.

#### [My Perfect CMS](https://rknight.me/blog/my-perfect-cms/)

I still haven't started working on this but I am getting closer now I've sorted all the [images on Almanac](https://rknight.me/blog/adding-covers-to-almanac/).

#### [Trying Raycast: Part One](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-one/)

I think I did a good job here, and in [part two](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-two/), covering the differences between Alfred and Raycast. 

#### [Slash Pages](https://rknight.me/blog/slash-pages/)

This project was done somewhat on a whim and it's been more popular than I could have hoped. Lots of new pages have been added to the site and I love seeing people add their slash pages.

#### [Please Rate Your Experience](https://rknight.me/blog/please-rate-your-experience/)

This one was written in five minutes in a rage and clearly I hit a sore spot with other people too.

### Conclusion 

If I didn't have the huge backlog of drafts I'm not sure I could have done this every single day. Maybe next year I'll try a theme for the posts. Either way, it's over. We did it. Only 335 days until WeblogPoMo2025.
