    >> name: Orzo Bolognese

    Brown off the @Beef Mince{500%g} in a saucepan

    Add the @Passata{500g}, @Beef Stock Cube{}, and the @Orzo{250%g}, and the @Water{250%ml}.

    Simmer for about ~{20%minutes} while stirring it occasionally otherwise it'll all stick together
    
    Stir in the @Cheese and any seasoning you fancy.

    Easy peasy. This makes a decent amount of portions for freezing.
