You know how sometimes you do one thing then you think "oh I'll do this other thing" then another thing related to that and the next thing you know you're making a weird website from a web component someone made because you can? No? Anyway.

[EmojiStorm](https://emojistorm.rknight.me/) is such a project. It starts with one instance of [Zach's `snow-fall` component](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall/) then you can just keep adding more but it's a random emoji. 

It gets a bit slow after ten or so depending on your computer so you've been warned.
