tl;dr: [Donate to our campaign here](https://stjude.omg.lol) at [stjude.omg.lol](https://stjude.omg.lol).

It's basically September which means it's childhood cancer awareness month and time for [Relay's annual fundraising event](https://relay.fm/stjude). Last year, [me and Adam raised $12,590.57](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2023-final-numbers/) as part of the campaign. This year we're going to try and beat that total and we have two exclusive stickers which you can get for [a donation of $15](https://stjude.omg.lol): Party Prami and Ruminate Heatwave.

Over on [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robbb) you can use a special St Jude theme for your omg.lol profile which you can see [on mine](https://robb.omg.lol) and [Adam's](https://adam.omg.lol) profile. You can also enable a "supporting St Jude" footer for your profile too! Here it all is in action:

Finally, every day on [bids.lol](https://bids.lol) they'll be a lifetime omg.lol code up for grabs and I'm sure Adam has some other tricks up his sleeve.

You can donate at [stjude.omg.lol](https://stjude.omg.lol) to grab your stickers. It's for the kids.
