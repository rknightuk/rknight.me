    >> name: Flatiron Mac and Cheese

    >> notes: To quickly roast the brussel sprouts, cut them in half and drizzle in olive oil, then bung them in the over for 15-20 minutes. | The recipe calls for Radiatori pasta but I've used farfalle before and it works just as well.

This recipe came to me via my friend Ali, who had it at [The Flatiron Room](https://theflatironroom.com) when he was living in New York. He's made it for us a bunch of times, including on my stag do, as you can in the accompanying photo.

As an aside, my stag do was three of us in a cabin in the middle of the Welsh countryside for three days and it was glorious.
