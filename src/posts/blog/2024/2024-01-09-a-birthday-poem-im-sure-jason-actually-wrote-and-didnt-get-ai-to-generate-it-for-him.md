![Happy Birthday card from Jason](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/happy-birthday-robb-from-jason.jpg)

It's my birthday today and [Jason](https://grepjason.sh) has been more enthusiastic than anyone about it, including me. He sent me this e-card and email which I'm sure he definitely hand-crafted himself. It's a response to [this toot about my home insurance company emailing me](https://social.lol/@robb/111727140488170177) which totally wasn't a "_thinly-veiled “please wish me a happy birthday, people of Mastodon” post_"[^1].

> In the dance of the years, another twirl,
> A special day unfolds for you, Robb, in this world.
> With laughter, joy, and dreams anew,
> May this birthday bring delights, bright and true.
> 
> From morning's light to evening's starry view,
> May each moment sparkle with happiness through.
> With friends like stars and memories to weave,
> A year of wonders is what we believe.
> 
> So blow out the candles, make a wish, take a slice,
> In the journey of life, each year is a new spice.
> From all of us at Hemispheric Views, near and far,
> Happy Birthday, Robb, you're our shining star!
