I'm going to try doing some quick posts like this going forward about things I like. Being the naming genius I am, I'm calling this series "Things I Like".

[Pizza the Action](https://condimaniac.com/products/condimaniac-pizza-the-action-pizza-seasoning) is a seasoning from the UK-based company Condimaniac. It’s a seasoning mix designed to, as the name might suggest, go on pizza. There’s nothing particularly surprising or unusual in the ingredients list:

- Tomato Flakes
- Garlic Granules
- Sea Salt
- Onion Granules
- Cayenne Pepper
- Nutritional Yeast Flakes
- Basil
- Oregano
- Smoked Paprika
- Thyme

Who doesn't love a "nutritional yeast flake"? Ignoring that one, whatever their exact combination of the ingredients is makes pizzas taste fantastic. Even some cheap store-brand ones I’ve had in the past month tasted _way_ better with a sprinkling of it. They suggest using it as seasoning for pizza sauce which I will definiely try with [my current sauce recipe](https://rknight.me/blog/one-year-of-pizza-making/) once the Ooni oven comes out again this summer.

Anyway, it’s tasty and I love it. I bought it from Ooni because I had some credit but they also sell it, along with a bunch of other pizza-related condiments, direct [on their website](https://condimaniac.com/collections/all).
