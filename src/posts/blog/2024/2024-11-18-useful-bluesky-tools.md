I've been helping getting [MacStories setup on Bluesky](https://www.macstories.net/news/macstories-is-on-bluesky/) this weekend and I came across a few handy sites. There are loads of interesting Bluesky-related links in this [awesome-bluesky](https://github.com/fishttp/awesome-bluesky?tab=readme-ov-file) list on GitHub, below is just the ones I happened upon and found useful.

[ClearSky](https://clearsky.app/rknight.me/lists) allows you to see which lists (starter packs) you're in, who you've blocked and who's blocked you. As an aside, the blocking data being public _and_ having no way to opt out of a starter pack shows a complete lack of consideration for how this could be abused but that's not the point of this post. Less important but why is seven the minimum for a starter pack [this makes me very sad](/notes/202411181234/).

I found two tools for resolving DIDs which you need for various API-related things. A DID is a "_persistent, long-term identifier for every account._" and they look something like this: `did:plc:b3i7xuqiybecdpm3lkywmlwv`.

- [Bluesky DID Resolver](https://rmdes.github.io/)
- [Bluesky DID Generator](https://bsky-did.neocities.org/) - confusingly named as a "generator"

To use Bluesky in Mastodon clients like Ivory, you can use [Skybridge](https://skybridge.fly.dev). I doubt I would ever check Bluesky if I couldn't use Ivory. I setup my own install of this with [Coolify](https://coolify.io). [Deck Blue](https://deck.blue) is a nice web client though.

Finally [SkyLink](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb?hl=en) is a Chrome extension similar (although not as advanced) to [Streetpass](https://streetpass.social/).

You can see all the MacStories team and podcast accounts in [the MacStories starter pack](https://bsky.app/starter-pack/macstories.net/3lb4aiut25l26) and I'm there as [@rknight.me](https://bsky.app/profile/rknight.me).
