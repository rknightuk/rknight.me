> The Converse have been retired. They lasted 305 days at a cost of 16p per day.

When I got married, I wore a suit and a pair of black Converse Chuck Taylor All Star's. They were brand new and the first time I wore them was the day of our wedding.

The day after I just put them on because the wedding was over and they could just go into the normal shoe rotation. Then a month went by and I realised I had worn them every day which gave me a data point I wish I'd done for the many other pairs of Converse I've bought over the years: how long does a pair _actually_ last? I had a vague idea but nothing concrete.

All was well until the 23rd of March, 196 days after the wedding, and the outer sole started to come apart from the upper. A pretty standard place for All Stars to start to fail.

Then this month on the 20th, 254 days after, I noticed the insoles are starting to wear a bit thin which is fine for now, but I may need to retire them soon.

Just for [Andrew](https://canion.blog/), this works out at a cost of 19p per day.

Yes, I took notes on when things started to break because I've never had the opportunity to measure this before. I will report back when they are no more.
