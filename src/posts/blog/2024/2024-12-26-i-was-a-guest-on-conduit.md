A couple of weeks ago, [Jay](https://kjaymiller.com/) reached out to see if I’d be like to be a guest on [Conduit](https://www.relay.fm/conduit) and of course I immediately said yes. 

We spoke about some of my projects including what I’m doing with [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) and then I was challenged[^1] to make a site, [which I did](https://rknight.me/blog/how-long-since-i-watched-mean-girls-/). In the [super conductors](http://imasuperconductor.com) post-show Jay asked me about British cars and I had to channel all of my knowledge from Top Gear and Grand Tour. 

[Listen to Conduit 91: Robb Knight made this for himself, and maybe you too](https://www.relay.fm/conduit/91) 

[^1]: It wasn’t a challenge but I took it as such
