When 8BitDo announced they were selling [a new keycap set](https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-retro-keycaps) that matched [my keyboard I got from them](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/) I ordered immediately. I didn't need new keycaps for it but I _really_ wanted to get rid of that pesky windows key. 

They arrived this morning in nice little trays:

At lunch I swapped out a bunch of them including a lot of the ones with symbols on, along with the larger-text <key>pgup</key>/<key>pgdown</key> over on the right hand side. Here's a comparison - I should have taken a before photo today but I forgot so I made do with what I had.

I didn't _need_ to spend $50 on these but I'm glad I did.
