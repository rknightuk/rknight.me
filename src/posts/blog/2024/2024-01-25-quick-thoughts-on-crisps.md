Now _this_ is a theme I can get behind. If my specialist subject for Mastermind couldn't be Back to the Future, "Crisps of the UK" might be a close second. Following in the footsteps of [Lynn](https://lynnandtonicblog.com/2024/01/25/my-quick-thoughts-on-chips/), [Dave](https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/), [Jonathan](https://snook.ca/archives/personal/quicker-thoughts-on-chips), and [Peter](https://pmullen.com/posts/more-quick-thoughts-on-chips/) here are my thoughts on ~~chips~~ crisps.

1. Prawn Cocktail is one of the finest flavours available and I'm sad this mostly doesn't exist outside the UK.
2. [Brannigans beef and mustard](https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/food-and-drink/brannigans-crisps-discontinued-pub-classic-britons-mourning-657852) were the best crisp ever made. The flavour, texture, everything. RIP.
3. Of course Pringles are crisps. Sorry Peter.
4. Salt and Vinegar crisps should have enough salt to make my mouth numb for a day.
5. The pretending-to-be-artisnal crisps like Kettle are better eaten out of a bowl each time you walk past said bowl.
