This week I added `/where` and `/someday` to [the Slashpages site](https://slashpages.net). I started making my own someday page, which is still in progress, but it got me thinking about a similar but distinct page: [/next](/next).

I see this page as a toned-down version of someday: rather than my hopes, dreams, and goals, it's movies and TV shows I want to watch, games I want to play, projects I want to start, that kind of thing.

With the work I've done on [KnightCMS](https://rknight.me/blog/knightcms-just-for-me/), I'm able to manage the content on this page easily from anywhere. Add a new show I want to watch, remove a book I've started (and add it to [my /now page](/now)), as well as add some notes about projects. This data is exposed on an API endpoint in KnightCMS which is then pulled into an Eleventy data file to display on the page. Here's what the /next list looks like in the CMS:

I have a real problem with forgetting which movies and TV shows I thought looked interesting so this page will serve as a reference when I'm looking for something to watch.
