Inspired by [Chris' post](https://chriskirknielsen.com/games/), herein lies my favourite games across the genres I play. Also like Chris, a â˜… indicates what I think is a greatest of all time game. I have a fairly large collection of physical games which you can see on [my games collection page](https://rknight.me/collections/games/).

### 3D Platformers

**â˜… [Jak and Daxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jak_and_Daxter:_The_Precursor_Legacy) (2001, PS2)**

I got the demo of this with the official Playstation 2 magazine and played that first area probably hundreds of times before I bought the full game. Since then I've played it every couple of years.

**â˜… [Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Rift_Apart) (2021, PS5)**

For me, the headline game for the PS5 and it didn't disappoint. Beyond the usual fun of a Ratchet and Clank game, the trigger feedback on the DualSense made this an incredible experience.

**[Ratchet and Clank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank_(2016_video_game)) (2016, PS4)**

I never played the original on PS2 when it came out so this was a nice treat. I'm aware it's not identical but it was fun regardless.

**[Super Mario Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey) (2017, Switch)**

I'm not a big Mario fan in general but I mostly loved this with the exception of the moons you can't get without using motion controls. 

**[Sackboy: A Big Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackboy:_A_Big_Adventure) (2020, PS5)**

I don't even remember why I bought this but I'm so glad I did. Some of the music levels, like the Uptown Funk one, are an absolute delight.

Honorable mentions:

- [Ratchet and Clank 2/Going Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Going_Commando) (2003, PS2)
- [Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackdown_(video_game)) (2007, 360)

### Third-Person Story-Driven

This is the hardest category for me to pin down favourites so I'm picking a handful but to be honest I could easily choose all of these as GOAT. The Playstation cup overfloweth with incredible games in this genre.

**â˜… [Grand Theft Auto: Vice City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_Vice_City) (2002, PS2)**

I love all the 3D series games (not you GTA4) including the PSP/PS2 ports but this one has something special. The soundtrack, the setting, the parodying of every 80s trope you can think of is all pulled off perfectly.

**â˜… [Sunset Overdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Overdrive) (2014, Xbox One)**

I bought an Xbox One specifically because I wanted to play this. I spent 8 hours a day for a week playing this, I just couldn't put it down. It's a shame this never got a sequel or remaster but without this game Spider-Man would not be as good as it is.

**â˜… [The Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us) (2014, PS4)**

In terms of story telling, this is the greatest game ever made, hands down. I started this game two or three times before it finally stuck though. The gameplay isn't the best in the genre (part two improves on it significantly) but as a package it's fantastic.

**â˜… [Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)) (2019, PS4)**

The atmosphere and gameplay in this is second-to-none. 

**â˜… [Immortals Fenyx Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_Fenyx_Rising) (2020, PS5)**

This game has no right to be as good as it is. If you dislike the style of joke writing, you will hate this game. As someone who didn't like Breath of the Wild because of the stupid breakable weapons, this is excellent.

Honorable mentions:

- [Life Is Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange_(video_game)) (2015, PS4)
- [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn) (2017, PS4)
- [Horizon Forbidden West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West) (2022, PS5)
- [The Last of Us Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II) (2020, PS4/5)
- [The Uncharted Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted) (2007-2022, PS3/4/5)
- [The Spider-Man series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(video_game_series)) (2018-2023, PS4/5)

### Sports

This might as well be a Skateboarding category but I do have a couple of non-Tony Hawk games here too.

**â˜… [Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_3) (2001, PS2)**

Itâ€™s hard to describe the affect this series had when the first game launched. If you haven't seen it, [the documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11698280/) is great. I must have played hundreds of hours of this over the years

**â˜… [Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2 Remaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_1_%2B_2) (2020, PS4)**

This is pinnacle of what a remaster should be. The levels are perfectly recreated, the increased amount of pro skaters (more than one person who isn't a dude ðŸ˜±), and the new songs on the soundtrack. It's all perfect. Just a shame Activision ruined everything by absorbing the developers so we'll never get a THPS3 remaster. Fuck you Activision.

**The other PS2 THPS games (2002-2007, PS2)**

THPS4 ramped up the difficultly significantly and Underground 1 and 2 were...bonkers. Project 8 was a great game in theory but the frame rate issues really let it down. I've heard the PS3 version is much better so I should fire up my copy soon.

**[Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Extreme_Skate_Adventure) (2003, PS2)**

This was built with the THPS4 engine so it plays more or less the same (once you enable advanced controls). It's kinda stupid (because it's made for kids) but if you like the THPS games this is a fun diversion from the series.

**[Fifa Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Street_(2005_video_game)) (2005, PS2)**

I don't like the culture around football and find watching it mind-numbingly boring but for whatever reason this particular configuration clicked with me. I even wrote a guide for it [on GameFAQs](https://rknight.me/blog/fifa-street-ps2-game-faqs/).

**[Behold the Kickmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behold_the_Kickmen) (2017, MacOS)**

This started as a joke and became a full-blown game. The humour is a bit smug and "lol football is stupid" but I enjoyed it. Probably because the developer dislikes football as much as I do.

**â˜… [Rocket League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League) (2015, PS4/5)**

For me, this is the ultimate evolution of the [Top Gear Toyota Aygo football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yBITRmNd4I). I still suck at it after hundreds of hours though.

Honorable mentions:

- [Swing Away Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_Away_Golf) (2000, PS2)
- [Mario Strikers Charged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Strikers_Charged) (2007, Wii)

### Racing

I don't care for realistic racing games, I much prefer arcade style.

**â˜… [Diddy Kong Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddy_Kong_Racing) (1997, N64)**

This is the best kart racer ever made. It has cars, planes, and boats. It has a story mode. I love it. 

**â˜… [Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_8) (2017, Switch)**

As much as I have a lot of love for Mario Kart 64, MK8 includes most of the tracks remastered so it's hard to pick that. With the DLC it has 96 tracks and most of them are good. Hard to beat that.

**[Hot Wheels Unleashed]() (2021, PS5)**

This games seemed to come out of nowhere but I grabbed it anyway. It's a hell of a lot of fun. Still haven't got the DeLorean though.

Honorable mentions:

- [Mario Kart 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_64) (1997, N64)
- [Rumble Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_Racing) (2001, PS2)
- [The Simpsons: Hit & Run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Hit_%26_Run) (2003, PS2)
- [Mashed Fully Loaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashed_(video_game)) (2005, PS2)
- [Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_All-Stars_Racing_Transformed) (2012, 360)
