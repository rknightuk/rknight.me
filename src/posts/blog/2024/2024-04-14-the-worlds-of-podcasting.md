On [this week's ATP](https://atp.fm/582) (around 25:00) John spoke about how a show he listens to said that a link would be on the website and he went out of his way to find that it just wasn't there. I feel bad for the hosts because I'm sure they _thought_ this would be done. Marco spoke about the "two worlds of podcasting" where one understands the platform and the other either doesn't, or just doesn't care.

I've had this same experience with the [Scrubs rewatch show](https://open.spotify.com/show/6qckOLN3q2qpZilM6i1MKv). On it, their producer was lamenting not having somewhere to post a link to something being spoken about. No mention of show notes because I'm not convinced "big podcast" even knows they exist. This happened multiple times in the first ten or so episodes and I would try, like John, to find these links online _somewhere_ but they just didn't exist. Even the tweets about the show wouldn't include links to the episodes just a "link in bio" which is less than useless to link to a specific episode. I stopped listening at around episode 15 because of this.

This shit is just lazy and I just don't even bother with shows like this any more. No show notes? You're out, you're barely even a podcast. Dynamic ad insertion? Definitely get fucked.
