[James wrote a great post](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/) with ~~100~~ 83 ideas for things to do on a website[^1] with a call for people suggest more so here's another ten suggestions to add to his list, most of which already exist on my site because I have no imagination.

1. A [uses page](/uses) with software, tools, whatever you use to do things you enjoy doing
2. A [collections page](/collections) to show off your games, books, stamps, or anything else you collect
3. A [colophon](/about/colophon) to explain how your website is created, built, and hosted
4. Create a [podroll](/podcasts/roll) to list the podcasts you like to listen to
5. A [wiki](/intersect) or a notes page to write down things you've learnt, little snippets of code, or useful website you use
6. A [version history page](/log/versions) to show what your website has looked like in the past
7. As an extension of James' number 33, add a [subscribe page](/subscribe) to list all the ways someone can see your blog posts like RSS and Mastodon
8. A [save page](/save) to list referral links for things you recommend
9. A [log of all](/almanac) the movies and tv shows you've watched, books you've read, and games (board or video) you've played
10. A [stats page](/blog/stats) to show how many words you've written in total, how many posts, or something else interesting about your site
