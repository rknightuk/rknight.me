Alex has an excellent post about how [they name their computers](https://alexwlchan.net/2024/how-i-name-my-computers/) which is, as they mention, a very important part of setting up a new device.

Unlike Alex, I don't choose a new name when it gets replaced - my iPhone is always called **Starlord**. Which brings me to the naming scheme: Marvel characters. Some of these make sense, some of them don't.

- Mac Mini: This is used for Plex and some other boring home things but it's the hub for the house or something. Anyway I went with [Jarvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.). Technically it's written `J.A.R.V.I.S.` but who's got time for that.
- MacBook Pro: This is my main computer and is called [Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_(Marvel_Comics)).
- iPhone: [Starlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-Lord)
- Apple Watch: [Rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon)
- AirPods Pro: [Maximoff](https://uncannyxmen.net/family-tree/magneto-maximoff-family-tree). Because there's two of them? A clever one.
- AirPods Max: [Magento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto_(Marvel_Comics)) because metal
- My black Apple Magic keyboard: [Black Widow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova))

My Beats Studio buds are the one exception to this naming rule because I thought of a name[^1] so good I couldn't _not_ use it: **Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them**. My iPad is called **Robb's iPad** because I don't use it enough to name it.
