While working on [Almanac](/almanac) to make sure all the posts have all the info and images they need, I came across two posts that didn't really fit there. Both of them were based on memes doing the rounds on Twitter in 2018 so I've moved them here such that they can be found easily.

### #GameStruck4

This one was doing the rounds on Twitter, I think from [this Vice post](https://www.vice.com/en/article/j5a4ay/whats-your-gamestruck4-the-four-games-that-define-you).
