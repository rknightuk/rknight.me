Annie has set a [WeblogPoMo challenge](https://weblogpomo.club/challenges) for this month, Ask Me Anything:

> I'm calling this challenge WeblogPoMo AMA (Ask Me Anything). For this challenge I want to foster writer interaction: write a blog post starting with a question—the AMA—and then answer the question yourself in the blog post.

There may have been some misunderstanding with how to source the questions so I'm doing some I [asked for on Mastodon](https://social.lol/@robb/113403816549745605) and some that other people have posted about.

**_What’s the best music-related experience of your life so far?_**

I didn't realise it until recently but I was at [Oasis' last ever gig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Out_Your_Soul_Tour) and that was a great experience even if I'm not a huge fan of them and it took me 15 years to realise it was thier last one. So that's pretty cool.

But the one that sticks out to me is not even an in-person experience. [Linkin Park's performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL1nlWOciL0) to announce a new singer, new tour, and new album was amazing to watch live. When Emily Armstrong came out for the second part of The Emptiness Machine it was glorious. I nearly went to bed instead of waiting up to watch it, thinking it would be a simple "oh here's a reissue of some old songs". Turns out that would have been a terrible idea.

**_What’s the first movie, ever watched that made a big impact on you, for good or bad?_**

My grandparents were looking after me when I was maybe 5 or 6 and they decided to pop in a video of a movie my mum had recorded: [Beetlejuice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094721/). It definitely wasn't age-appropriate but it's one of my only memories from when I was a kid so it defintiely fits the bill of big impact.

The other is Back to the Future which I watched for the first time around the same age and I've watch all three of them basically [every year since then](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2022-09-18-back-to-the-future/). I even have a Delorean tattoo.

**_What runs through your head when you can’t fall asleep?_**

I have the ability to just sit and think about nothing, like truly just no thoughts which annoys my wife no end. If I can't sleep I usually just get up and do something else then go back to bed an hour later. Life hack™.

**_Favorite pizza toppings?_**

I like all pizza[^2], it is the perfect food. I am partial to spicy toppings so, ignoring all other variables I'd go for pepperoni, chillis or jalapeños, and pineapple.

**_What would shock your younger self about your present self? I mean absolutely obliterate their sense of identity. Leave them rocking in a corner._**

I have a child and a second one on the way and they were both on purpose.

**_What's your worst and fav childhood memories?_**

I've say on this question since it was asked and I have...nothing (except the Beetlejuice one above). I don't think I have any memories before about 10 years old. Not that my childhood was bad but I can't think of anything that stands out in either direction. Sorry Alexandra, what a rubbish answer.

**_Why are you the way you are?_**

I assume by this Lewis means why am I so funny on the 'don with bangers like this toot in response to Lewis saying he was in an "autumnal funk".

> the lesser-known follow up to Uptown Funk

Jokes aside, trying to get validation on the internet is way cheaper than therapy.

**_What's your opinions of Americans in general? How are different than your countrymen?_**

This is an interesting one to ask, this week of all weeks. All of the Americans I'm friends with are awesome[^1] and generally every American I've interacted with in my life has been perfectly polite. Most of the stereotypes I think of when I think of Americans are actually things about _America_ and not the people: healthcare, guns, whatever the fuck "grits" is. There are two things I find different: 1. What the fuck do you give your kids to drink if you don't have [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(drink)). 2. Y'all _are_ really loud in comparison to the rest of the world. This was most obvious when I was in Rome, I could hear American tourists before I could see them.

So there we go. I might do another one of these if more questions pop up I want to answer.


[^1]: This is a bit self-selecting because I wouldn't be friends with dickheads, regardless of country of where they're from
