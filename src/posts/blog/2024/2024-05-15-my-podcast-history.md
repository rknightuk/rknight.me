In 2005 I got an iPod Video (5th generation) for Christmas. The first thing I did was plug it in and start syncing my music collection that I'd been ripping in preparation for getting it. While I was waiting for the music to transfer over the mega-slow USB 2.0, I started browsing the podcasts section and came across [The Ricky Gervais show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ricky_Gervais_Show). I think at this time it was the number one podcast in the store. The only other show I listened to at the time was one called [Top of the Pods](http://www.topofthepods.co.uk) which was kind of like [Top Four](https://www.relay.fm/topfour/) but they did a top ten list of _whatever_ - tech products, movie sequels, or time machines. I'm amazed the site is still up but sadly the episodes are not. If anyone has them available, please send them my way.

A few years later I listened to [Today in iPhone](https://tii.libsyn.com) for a couple of months and then I kind of fell off the podcast wagon - at this point podcast listening was still limited to syncing from iTunes which was a pain in the arse.

Around 2011, through Twitter, I heard about some guy called Myke Hurley doing a show with Patrick Rhone called [Enough](http://notquiteenough.com). That led me to listen to Myke's other shows he had on his network including Cooking with Brett and Myke, 11 Minutes, and eventually the [512 Podcast](https://512pixels.net/2012/02/512-podcast-launch/). By this point, apps like Instacast were available on iOS which made subscribing a hell of a lot easier.

In 2013 Myke joined 5by5 and in 2014 he and Stephen launched [Relay FM](https://www.relay.fm)[^1]. During this time, [Bionic ended](https://www.relay.fm/bionic) and became [Bonanza](https://www.relay.fm/bonanza), along with [CMD+Space](https://www.relay.fm/cmdspace), and [The Prompt](https://www.relay.fm/prompt) ending. It was also around this time I started using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) and I haven't switched to another app since. [No smart speed though](https://rknight.me/blog/smart-speed-broke-my-brain/).

Now I'm mostly listening to a handful Relay shows like [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected), [Rec Diffs](https://www.relay.fm/rd), and [Ungeniused](https://www.relay.fm/ungeniused) plus  [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com), [ATP](https://atp.fm), and [Really Specific Stories](https://www.rsspod.net). Since ~~_the incident_~~ 2020, my listening has gone down a lot due to not commuting every day so I tend to skip news-heavy shows if I don't have the time that week but I still fill every silent moment with podcasts lest I have to be alone with my own thoughts.

Oh and if you didn't know, I have [my own podcast](https://macstories.net/ruminate) which you should definitely listen to.
