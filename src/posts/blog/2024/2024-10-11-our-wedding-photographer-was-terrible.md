This was going to be a scathing review of our wedding photographer I planned on posting because I was furious having waited 6 months to get the photos but he's basically gone bust anyway and I've calmed down since then. I'm posting it anyway because it's been in my post drafts for months and I want it for reference. Name of the photographer is redacted because quite frankly life's too short.

On the wedding day:

- Was late
- Complained endlessly about having to pay for parking until the make up person told him to get over it
- Forget his camera after walking us 15 minutes away from the venue so we had to stand around and wait until he came back with it
- Was giving one of our guests an inordinate and inappropriate amount of attention, as pointed out to us by many of our other guests
- Made us wait far too long for the cake cutting and the first dance because he wasn't even remotely ready. Then complained about the location of the cake despite it being there the entire day.

Now for actually getting our photos:

- **14th November 2023, 66 days since the wedding**: Messaged on WhatsApp where I had previously messaged with [redacted]. No response.
- **21st November, 73 days**: Messaged on Facebook messenger. [redacted] replied the next day saying photos would be ready "next week"
- **8th December, 90 days**: Gallery link was sent with the photos but all of the group photos were missing.
- **14th December, 96 days**: Messaged to ask about group photos, pre-wedding shoot photos, and the pin to download the photos. Seen, no response.
- **21st December, 103 days**: My wife messaged him asking him to respond to me on his personal account. No response to her
- **22nd December, 104 days**: "I am going to take a look and get back to you"
- **January 18th, 131 days**: Messaged. Seen, no response.
- **January 27th, 140 days**: Messaged. Seen, no response.
- **February 2nd, 147 days**: Messaged, more firm. Finally got a response and told me to calm down. Told he will get to us "first thing in the morning"
- **February 3rd, 148 days**: Got the missing group photos but still no pin to download them. "Give me 2 secs I'll send you an email". No email or pin.
- **February 17th, 162 days**: Messaged to ask for a pin and the pre-wedding shoot photos. Seen, no response.
- **February 25th, 170 days**: Messaged again. Seen, no response.
- **2nd March, 177 days**: Messaged again, responded the next day.
- **3rd March, 178 days**: Got the pin to download the photos finally. "I will forward you pre wedding photos in the morning.". He did not.
- **5th March, 180 days**: Messaged again. Finally got a response with the pre-wedding shoot photos 24 hours later.

So it took just shy of 3 months to get some, but not all, of the photos. Then just shy of 6 months to actually be able to download them. To make any progress we always had to chase [redacted], not once did he give us an update without prompting from us. 

Even once we did get them, it was clear they hadn't been checked or edited, there was at least a few photos that had fingers in the way or were blurry and one photo that wasn't even from our wedding.

And, scene.
