Okay so maybe the [definition of sitelet](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sitelet#English) doesn't quite fit but it's close enough to describe these common pages people have on their sites. Maybe it needs a better name. Pagelets? Web dongles? Barnacles? Do they need a name? I want one.

> [Shellsharks suggested "slash pages"](https://shellsharks.social/@shellsharks/112416323777089561) which I like.

Anyway, Chris had an idea [for a /interests page](https://chrisburnell.com/note/slash-interests/), similar to [/about](/about), [/now](/now) and [/uses](/uses).

> This page is, in essence, a place for website authors to list out things theyâ€™re passionate about and expound on what it is about those things that excites them

A great idea that goes beyond what would make sense on an about page. Those tend to be shorter, an introduction to who the person is and what they do but if you were _really_ into looking at old maps that doesn't necessarily fit there.

Chris also, smart fella that he is, set up an [interests directory](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory/) where people can submit their site. Mine is now there.

I took a first pass at my interests page [which you can see here](/interests). I stuck to the obvious things like movies, tv shows, and games but I'm going to expand this over time. Chris' post also reminded me I should do an /ideas page but that's a job for another day.
