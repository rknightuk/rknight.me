[The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast](https://the-lonely-island-and-seth-meyers-podcast-7a1ee071.simplecast.com) is so good. This came to me [via Marty](https://blast-o-rama.com/2024/04/09/if-youre-like.html) and I'm so glad he thought to post about it. I _love_ The Lonely Island and the first four episodes of this show are great.

Each episode they talk about one of their digital shorts from SNL starting with [Lettuce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxxaCMNe-2g) which I hadn't seen before. Hearing how [Lazy Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRhTeaa_B98) came together was wonderful.

As someone who did [my own parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUJwjKdy4mU) of a Lonely Island song, I can't wait to hear the episode about I'm on a Boat. Pretty sure I've not shared that link on my site before so there you go.
