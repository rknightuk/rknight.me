    >> name: Leek and Bacon Jacket Potatoes

    >> notes: There are many ways to make a jacket potato, I choose the microwave way because it's quicker.

    Pre-heat the oven to 200Â°c. 

    Jab your @Jacket potatoes{2} with a fork a handful of times and put in the microwave for ~{15%minutes}, turn halfway through.

    Put your jackets in the oven while you make the topping.

    Cook the @Chopped Bacon{8%rashers} in a pan with a little bit of oil until browned off, then add in @Leeks{40%g} and fry those for ~{2-3%minutes}. Turn the heat down and add in @Cream Cheese{165%g}, @Black Pepper{}, and @Paprika, and stir it all together.

    Cut your jackets in half, add some @Butter to them, then top with the leek and bacon topping. Sprinkle some paprika on top to serve.
