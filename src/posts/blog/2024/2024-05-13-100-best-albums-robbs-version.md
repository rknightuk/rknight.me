If you're interested in what I consider a perfect album [I wrote about it](https://rknight.me/blog/the-perfect-album/) last week and if you want to see other people's perfect albums, check out [the perfect albums project](https://albums.rknight.me).

![Robb's Best 100 Albums](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/top-100-albums.jpg)

This post was originally going to be the same idea as [fLaMEd's](https://flamedfury.com/) post with their [top 50 artists](https://flamedfury.com/posts/top-50-artists-2021-2024/). Then [Apple decided we should all be arguing about album rankings](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-music-celebrates-the-launch-of-inaugural-100-best-albums-list/?1715605182) so here we are. I also wanted to do the silly title so I changed it to top 100 albums.

I exported all my Last.fm data from the 29th August 2021 until now and parsed the data to rank artists and albums by number of plays - see the bottom of this post for the technical bits.

Here are my top 100 albums. Note, I _do_ listen to Hamilton a lot but this is skewed a bit because it has more tracks than any other album by a lot but I didn't think it was all that important for this list and quite frankly didn't have the energy to fetch the album lengths to work out actual plays.

To get this data I used [this exporter](https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/) to get a CSV of all my scrobbles then I wrote a quick node script to output the top 50 for me. I used the [`csvtojson` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson) to convert the file to JSON, did the counts for albums and artists, sorted by largest, then output to a `txt` file. 

I had to do some checking of the album because it seems as though the Hamilton recording has changed artist a few times, and I also added some overrides for different editions of the same albums:

```js
rawData.forEach(row => {
	let artistKey = row['Artist']

	let albumKey = `${row['Album']} - ${row['Artist']}`
	if (row['Album'].startsWith('Hamilton: An American Musical')) {
		albumKey = 'Hamilton: An American Musical - Original Broadway Cast'
		artistKey = 'Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton'
	}

	if (row['Album'].startsWith('Meteora')) {
		albumKey = 'Meteora - Linkin Park'
	}

	if (row['Album'].startsWith('The Eminem Show')) {
		albumKey = 'The Eminem Show - Eminem'
	}

	// this was reported as Goldfinger and Biffy Clyro?
	if (row['Album'].startsWith('Never Look Back (Deluxe)')) {
		albumKey = 'Never Look Back (Deluxe) - Goldfinger'
	}

	if (row['Album'].startsWith('Hybrid Theory')) {
		albumKey = 'Hybrid Theory - Linkin Park'
	}

	if (!raw.artists[artistKey]) {
		raw.artists[artistKey] = 0
	}

	raw.artists[artistKey]++

	if (!raw.albums[albumKey]) {
		raw.albums[albumKey] = 0
	}

	raw.albums[albumKey]++
});
```
