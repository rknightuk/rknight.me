We got married in September last year, having previously been booked in to do it in September 2020 and May 2021. 

We had a small wedding so we didn't need to be precise with the number of people attending for the most part but we[^1] did want a website where we could put all the information, show a countdown, and have an RSVP form.

To make the site I used a new framework called "plain HTML and CSS with a little bit of javascript". It's pretty advanced, you can do a lot with it.

The site doesn't have anything fancy. The RSVP form ran using [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/forms/), everything else is just written directly in the HTML. There isn't anything particularly impressive about the site but I am quite happy with how the timeline came out:

Because of all the date cancellations the site didn't really get used - by the third date we knew exactly who was and wasn't coming. Seems a shame to keep it hidden on my computer so the [source code is now on GitHub](https://github.com/rknightuk/wedding-website) for your perusal and I guess use it for your wedding if you want? There's also [a live demo up here](https://rknightuk.github.io/wedding-website/) but the RSVP won't work.
