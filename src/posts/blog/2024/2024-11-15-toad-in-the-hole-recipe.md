    >> name: Toad in the Hole

    >> notes: This is a _really_ lazy way of doing it. You could make your own batter if you have more time and patience than me

    Preheat the oven to 180Â°c, oil up a dish, and pop that in the oven for ~{10-15%minutes}

    Fry the @Sausages{6} so the skin is lightly browned off.

    Make some batter from a @Batter Mix{} ([example](https://groceries.asda.com/product/pancake-batter-mixes/just-essentials-by-asda-batter-mix-125-g/1000265255205)), or make your own.

    Take out the now-heated dish, pour in the batter mix, then pop the sausages in.

    Put it back in the oven for ~{25-30%minutes} until the batter and sausages are golden brown.

    Make some @Gravy and serve. I like [Bisto finest](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/bisto-best-beef-gravy-granules/431987-711062-711063) but whatever you like. You can even share it if you're feeling generous.

Right folks, this is the laziest "recipe" ever but it's great so here we are: toad in the hole. I will take a better photo next time I make it, I had to pull this one from my Instagram/Pixelfed archive.
