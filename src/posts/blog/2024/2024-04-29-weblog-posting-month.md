Last week Anne [put up a page for WeblogPoMo](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024):

> What is it? Weblog Posting Month, 2024! If you use weblog.lol, or otherwise have a personal blog, you should absolutely participate in this month-long blog posting extravaganza!

I said I'd participate so here we are, publicly committing to 31 posts across 31 days in May. My "guiding theme", as Anne suggests I choose, is "I have a lot of unfinished draft posts and I should finish them".

Look out for posts such as “phrases I always forget” and “every phone I’ve ever owned”. I know, I'm pretty excited too.

You can follow along with the hashtag `#WeblogPoMo2024`, [the @pomo account](https://beep.town/@Pomo) will be tooting posts, and you can see a list of [participants here](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators).
