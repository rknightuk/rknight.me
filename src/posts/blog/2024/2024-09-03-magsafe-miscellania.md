Last week I asked if anyone had suggestions for a MagSafe car mount and I got a ton of recommendations. Loads of love for [Peak Design](https://uk.peakdesign.com/pages/mobile) but I'm not paying that much just to hold my phone. Lots of people also suggested various no-name brand ones from Amazon which were much more palatable to me.

I ended up with [this one by a company called Lisen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CHVV5WKJ). It sticks directly to the dashboard, doesn't wobble around, and it supports 15W charging (once I bought a [cigarette lighter adaptor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BVZK3MHF)).

Because Apple's silicon cases kept falling apart on me over the past few years I've been on the whatevers-cheapest-on-ali-express case train for a few years but none of the ones I own are MagSafe compatible. This meant trudging through endless pages of various shades of grey cases along with some that looked like they were just waved past a color in the factory. I just wanted something _fun_. Orange! Neon green! Hot pink! 

These are few and far between if you want MagSafe but I stumbled upon the very well named [_GaoBao Strong Magnetic for iPhone 14 Pro Case, Slim Fit 14 Pro Phone Case Compatible with MagSafe Classic Shockproof Translucent Matte Protective Phone Cover for iPhone 14 Pro 6.1" 2022, Hot Pink_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0D1BZXKN8). How pink is it? None more pink:

It's far from the best quality case but it does the job. Also note the seemingly-random "100% focus pixels" around the camera. What the fuck does that even mean?

I installed the mount in the car and left it 24 hours as per the instructions and it's been great. I can get my phone off without worrying about ripping the mount off, it rotates and extends so I can put it exactly where I need it, and the pink cases does what it should.

MagSafe is pretty good. I'm only four years late.
