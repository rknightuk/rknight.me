This post is inspired by episode [015 of Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/015).

When I started drafting this post, I got distracted trying to find the first game I ever played. Turns out it was Asterisk Tracker which you can [read all about here](https://rknight.me/blog/finding-asterisk-tracker/). I played that game for endless hours on an Amstrad computer of some kind, loading it up from the floppy disk, and mashing that space bar trying to get as far as I could. That was my first experience with a computer, the "family computer". I don't ever remember my parents doing anything on it but I guess they must have done?

I don't remember when it happened but at some point that computer, and that game, were no more. There was another family computer that was around a bit later where I played just the one game again: [The Adventures of Captain Comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Captain_Comic). It was a side-scrolling platformer that I was not good at. I'm pretty sure I never made it past the first level. As was always the case with games of this era, the box art portrays something you're definitely not getting from the game.

A few years went by until I was around 10 and I got given a computer that definitely _was not_ liberated from a Naval Base where my step-dad worked as IT support. It had a 1GB hard drive I was convinced I would never fill up and it also came with a pirated copy of Microsoft Encarta. This had Windows 98 Plus on it which came with [the Garfield theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJuTOnbjWV4) which I thought was the best thing ever. There was one more Windows PC after this which lasted until I moved out at 18.

I'd just moved out and didn't have a lot of money so I bought the cheapest Asus laptop I could find. It was made of terrible plastic, it was slow, and it creaked when you picked it up. I didn't really have a lot of "computing" to do at this time so it was mostly for watching pirated movies and tv shows. A couple of years later I got a Samsung netbook (remember those?) which quite frankly wasn't any better than the Asus other than it was smaller. At this point, I was at college studying network (Cisco CCNA anyone?) so I still didn't know I wanted to be a developer.

Then, in 2009, I got my first Mac: a 2009 27” iMac which [I wrote about here](https://rknight.me/blog/my-first-mac/). This came just around the time I was getting into development although at this point I thought I was going to be a designer but it turns out I suck at design. Next up was a MacBook Air, then a MacBook Pro, then another Pro, then the one I have now: a 2023 16" MacBook Pro M2 Max with 64GB. What Apple has done with the M series chips is nothing short of incredible - the battery life is bonkers, the fans rarely kick in, and everything is stupidly fast.
