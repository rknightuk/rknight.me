I hit 100 articles saved in Raindrop this week and there's no way I can post them all individually so here we go for link dump volume three.

I got a [new keyboard this week](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/) and that led me down a rabbit hole of Mac utilities and also keycaps.

- [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app/) - [Joshua](https://joshuagrady.omg.lol) mentioned this to me and I'm annoyed I didn't know about it sooner. This sets one key to do all four modifiers at once (<kbd>â‡§</kbd> + <kbd>âŒƒ</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>) for using with keyboard shortcuts in various apps.
- [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/) - This is by the same person as Hyperkey. Hold down <kbd>âŒ¥</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> then move the mouse to get a grid of apps to switch to. I love this so much.

I haven't tried these two yet but they were also sent to me after the keyboard post:

- [rcmd - Switch apps instantly using the âŒ˜ Right Command key](https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd/)
- [The SpaceFN concept](https://kbd.news/The-SpaceFN-concept-2315.html)

I ordered [this Mario question mark keycap](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004415428803.html) to replace my escape key because why not. I cannot afford for this to be a new hobby at all.
