Since the last time I [posted my homescreen](/blog/homescreen-november-2017/) in 2017 the main change is widgets. I still kind of dislike them and wish I could customise them more but it's better than not having them.

Top left is [Marvis Pro](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/marvis-pro/id1447768809) which aside from being a nice music player, also integrates with Last.fm; the main reason I use it. The other widgets are Fantastical and Reminders.

Most of the apps have been on my homescreen for long time with the exception of two. [Huckleberry](https://huckleberrycare.com) is a baby tracking app for keeping track of feeds, sleeps, meds, and poops. It's pretty crap but my wife chose it and it's free for what we need. [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/home) is my current read-later app. It's lovely, and free, but doesn't _quite_ do what I want so I'm in the research phase of trying some other services.

My wallpaper is Baby Knight and I have the large photo widget on the screen to the left[^1]. And dark mode is on always.

[^1]: I have no idea what this screen is called.
