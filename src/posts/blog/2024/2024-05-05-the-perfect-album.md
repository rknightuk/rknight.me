On [Hemispheric Views 110](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/110) Jason presented the following question:

> Pick in your mind a perfect album. And I think it's mostly open to interpretation, but I'm kind of thinking an album that you would say you could just start from beginning, let it run all the way through, without skipping songs, without moving around, just front to back and just sit there and do nothing else and just listen to that whole album.
>
> What would that album be?

I have loads of albums I love but many of them have a track or two (or sometimes stupid interludes) that I skip. In the proper fashion of ignoring the question, I have four I want to present here plus some honourable mentions.

**[Meteora - Linkin Park (2003)](https://musicthread.app/link/1xDSepfSVc0Q0moM83u1OmuJN18)**

For a while I considered Hybrid Theory as my favourite album of all time but having listened more again recently it's been bumped to number two for this. Every track on this is a banger. Also, Faint has become my go-to karaoke track in the past couple of years.

**[Palm Trees and Power Lines - Sugarcult (2004)](https://musicthread.app/link/1xDSeoArPOCrpESs52IqIqK9eCi)**

I heard an acoustic cover of Memory on [Punk Goes Acoustic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_Goes_Acoustic) many years ago,  decided to check this album out, and it's been on heavy rotation since then.

***[The Black Parade - My Chemical Romance (2006)](https://musicthread.app/link/1xDSrJqBMiTwCqMnOuiBn524sE9)***

Not much to say about this other than it's fantastic. There's so much energy in all the tracks.

**[All Day - Girl Talk (2010)](https://illegalart.net/allday/)**

This is a mashup album so not exactly in the spirit of the question but when I don't know what _type_ of music I want, this is what I go to.
