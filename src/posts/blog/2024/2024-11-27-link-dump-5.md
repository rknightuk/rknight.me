Time for a heaving link dump becuase I'm well into triple figures in my Raindrop inbox.

First up are a pair of intorductions: one to [Alpine.js](https://blakewatson.com/journal/alpinejs-for-home-cooked-apps/) by Blake of [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com) fame and one for [htmx](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-single-page-app-with-htmx/). I'm always on the lookout for something a bit less complicated than a full-on framework.

[Things you forgot (or never knew) because of React](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/antiquated-react#epilogue) is a scathing look at the state[^1] of React in comparison to other, similar frameworks and it's not great. 

[Ergonomic Static Site Blogging](https://alextheward.com/posts/ergonomic-static-site-blogging/). Someone else on a quest to have a nice CMS for a static site with no success.

[Leon](https://lmika.org/2024/11/23/to-deploy-from.html) and [Melanie](https://melkat.blog/p/hosting-bsky) both wrote up their experience with [Coolify](https://coolify.io) with the latter setting up a Bluesky PDS for shits and giggles[^2]:

> The hardest part of all of this was Bluesky’s instability. Bluesky likes to pretend that it is “decentralized” or “federated.” It sure as shit isn’t either of those things.

[How I teach Eleventy from scratch](https://hamatti.org/posts/how-i-teach-eleventy-from-scratch/) is an excellent intro to Eleventy by Juha-Matti; this will be my go-to next time someone asks about how to get started.

One more tutorial, this time for [CSS sprite sheet animations](https://leanrada.com/notes/css-sprite-sheets/).

[Coding Font](https://www.codingfont.com/) sets up a bracket like the sports do to choose the best coding font for you. It lacks a few popular ones but it's a fun distraction for a couple of minutes.

Kagi, the search engine, [open-sourced their feed parser](https://github.com/kagisearch/fastfeedparser). "It's 10x-100x faster than a traditional feedparser".

[Can I PHP?](https://caniphp.com/) It's like _Can I Use_ but for PHP features. Fun.

I was [wronged by Safari](https://rknight.me/notes/202411160731/) and was sent this [great post on browsers by Tyler](https://tylersticka.com/journal/browsers-again/). Also, it's [not just me](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/safari-pages-intermittently-stop-loading-until-i-restart-mac.2344669/).

Gamery released [ScanDex](https://scandex.gamery.app/), a "_curated barcode database for video games_" and [Foursquare released a huge places dataset](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/20/foursquare-open-source-places/).

I don't have much call for doing web videos but [player.style](https://player.style/) look likes a great resource for different styles.

Johnny mentioned he used [Migadu Email](https://www.migadu.com/pricing/#are-the-prices-and-limits-per-mailbox-or-account) for his email. Pricing looks great, unlimited domains and mailboxes. If I ever need to move off of iCloud, this might be the way to go.

[“Back to the Future” and “The Goonies” take place on the same day](https://spoiledbluemilk.com/2020/10/23/back-to-the-future-and-the-goonies-take-place-on-the-same-day/). Can't argue with this logic, it's canon now.

I am obsessed with [Wes Tank Rapping Fox in Socks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5wvurTU5DI) on the Dr Suess channel.

[An Alkaline Trio font](http://damnette97.com).

And finally, I want this [clothes shop for dads](https://retro.social/@ifixcoinops/110823507738743826) idea to be a reality.

> you're sure as hell not gonna advertise some bugger else's T-shirt business on your body, so you give him twelve quid and he hands you Bin Bag 2
