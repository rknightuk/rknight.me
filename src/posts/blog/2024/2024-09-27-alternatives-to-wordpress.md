After all the [Wordpress drama this week](https://birchtree.me/blog/the-core-thing-that-makes-wordpress-wordpress-isnt-what-you-think/) I [tooted the following](https://social.lol/@robb/113203986371157848):

> We really need a new, easy to use, CMS written in PHP to compete with Wordpress.

> Why PHP? Because you dump files on a server, any server, and it just works.

Loads of people jumped into my mentions to point me to alternatives that exist and here they are.

- [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net/) - This one is interesting because it's a fork of Wordpress without the Gutenberg block editor.
- [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) - I know people who swear by Kirby and it's _really_ flexible.
- [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)
- [Cecil](https://cecil.app/) - This is a static site generator so not _quite_ what I was asking for but it looks like a solid product
