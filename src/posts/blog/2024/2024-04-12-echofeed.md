It’s taken a bit longer than expected but EchoFeed is now out of beta and ready for sign ups. If you wanna jump right in you can [sign up now](https://echofeed.app/register). 

There’s a slew of features that have made it into the first release including support for:

- Mastodon
- Micro.blog
- Bluesky
- GitHub
- Webmentions
- Web requests/webhooks

Mastodon and Bluesky can automatically include images with your posts and if you want to get your posts in front of more people you can enable Amplify which will boost Mastodon posts from the dedicated account at [@echofeedamplify@beep.town](https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify). 

Pricing is simple: you get one echo for free which updates every 15 minutes. For $25 a year you can upgrade to EchoFeed pro for unlimited echoes and updates every two minutes. 

If you’re a member of [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb) you can get $5 off that price - just connect your account on the subscription page and the discount will be automatically applied. 

EchoFeed has been running with an incredible group of beta testers for the past couple of weeks so everything should be ironed out. All of them have been great at finding the edge cases and bugs to help make EchoFeed as good as it can be:
