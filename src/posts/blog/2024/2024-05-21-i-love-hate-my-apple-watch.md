Ready for some first-world problem whinging? Of course you are.

> It's the most personal product we've ever made

This is how Apple described the Apple Watch when it was introduced. And yet here we are nine years later without custom watch faces or even a way to make our own based on the components of other ones.

The watchOS 10 update changed what the buttons on the side do. That's been about as much fun as a kick in the crotch.

For the past few months every time there's an update available, my watch tells me I don't have any space because even though I have music syncing off, it has 2GB of music on it that I can't get rid of. I finally fixed this by wiping my watch and setting it up again. Cool, very normal way of fixing problems.

When I try to set a reminder with Siri, it hangs for ages then tells me it can't do it so I do it on my phone. But it did do it because it's _right there in Reminders_.

And yet I still want it. Like, can't function without it. If I don't wear it for a day I get annoyed because I miss messages, have to set timers on my phone[^1], and have to pull my phone out to check the time. A person cannot live like that.

Like my series 0 Apple Watch, I'm going to cling onto my series four until it dies, or until Apple stop supporting it. Then I'll begrudgingly buy a new one.
