![Welcome to the Knight Club](http://cdn.rknight.me/site/knightclub.jpg)

Jarrod [set up a site](https://jb.heydingus.net/2024/03/11/too-tired-to.html) a few days ago, [One a Month Club](https://oneamonth.club), which is a collection of people offering memberships at $1 a month. This was inspired by [Manu's post](https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month) about the same thing:

> I recently realized that tiers are the wrong approach [...] I also realized that 1$+/month is the best price possible when it comes to supporting online creators

My [Buy Me a Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rknightuk), aside from having the existing one-time buy option, now has a £1 a month membership option. I've called it "The Knight Club" because that is the best pun and I am the worst. To quote myself:

> This is the Knight Club. All money will go towards web things like hosting, domains, and the occasional energy drink to keep me going. Just some support that says "I think the things you're doing are cool and you're very handsome". Okay, maybe not that second part.

Right now I'm not offering anything extra except the satisfaction of making me smile but I might add some perks in the future when I think of something that's appropriate; I don't want to paywall the things I make, those are better served being available to everyone but _something_. As a treat.

Anyway, go check out the [One a Month Club](https://oneamonth.club) to see lots of great people doing cool internet things and if you want you can [become a member of the Knight Club](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rknightuk).
