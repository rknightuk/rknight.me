Last week I tooted a poll to decide what my next post should be for [WeblogPoMo](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/weblogpomo/), Ben [jokingly asked](https://social.lol/@bendaubney/112362011039081959):

> Is ‘My Favourite Games’ a compilation of the best covers of The Cardigans track?

Of course, it wasn't. Then I went down a rabbit hole for over an hour and listened to every possible cover I could find on YouTube and Apple Music to pick the best ones. An excellent use of my time if I do say so myself and I've whittled it down to a handful that I think are well done.

- [Dance cover by Samstone & Aktive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPMHTv2w2iE)
- [Metal cover by Leo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1qkLQrqTsM)
- [Rock cover by Future Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Rvm406nQiY)
- [Acoustic cover by Joe Hicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlc9GUmph8c)
- [Another acoustic cover by Ethan Cronin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8NPV8DKKIE)
- [I don't even know how to categorise this one but it's fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6naRaxq8_o)

I also found [this live performance ripped from a VHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azTbhaHhcno).

So there you go.
