    >> name: Cheesy Chicken and Bacon Pasta

    >> notes: This doesn't reheat as well as I'd like, it tends to dry out more than other pasta dishes. | This is easily enough for 4 people so halve the quantities if it's just for two people.

    Cook the @Penne Pasta{500%g} as per instructions, drain, and put to one side.

    Cook the @Chopped Bacon{8%rashers} in a pan with a little bit of oil until crispy, set aside.

    In the same pan, add @Chicken{500%g}, @Salt, @Pepper, @Garlic Powder{}, and @Italian Seasoning{}, then cook until the chicken is cooked through and golden. Set aside.

    Add @Heavy Cream{250%g} and @Chicken Broth{250%g} to the pan, add in the @Parmesan{125%g} and stir on a low/medium heat for ~{5-10 minutes} until the sauce thickens. 

    Add the bacon, chicken, and pasta back into the pan and stir to combine.
