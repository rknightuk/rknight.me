I cannot stop thinking about [this Waffle House video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jky5ZXI0axc&feature=youtu.be) and their bonkers system for "marking" orders. It involves placing packets of jelly, ketchup, and other things a Waffle House has knocking about in specific places on a plate.

John and Merlin spoke about it for almost the entirety of [episode 232 of Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd/232) and it's also come up in follow up in the next two episodes.

I'm still not 100% convinced that this isn't some kind of elaborate hoax.
