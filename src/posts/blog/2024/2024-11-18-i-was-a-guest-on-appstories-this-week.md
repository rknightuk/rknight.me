The past few weeks [AppStories](https://appstories.net) has had a different MacStories host as a guest and this week was my turn. In the AppStories+ pre-show we talk about the origins of [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com) and in the main show we discuss the fediverse and ActivityPub, some of my [projects](/projects), as well as my development setup. Stick around to find out what kind of person Federico thinks I am because I'm still reeling.

Listen to episode [412: What Kind of Person Are You?](https://appstories.net/episodes/412) in your podcatcher of choice or you can watch the [episode on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyoH2ndxTLk).
