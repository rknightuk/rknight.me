### Personal

#### Home and DIY

In September during some rather heavy rain we forgot to bring our awning in and it [snapped off it's brackets](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/awning-down.jpg). That was a fun adventure trying to remove that without smashing the patio doors. My dad has offered to buy us a new one which I'll need to fit in the new year.

We moved my office into the larger spare room and moved Baby Knight into my old office so Baby Knight two can be next to our bedroom. This meant I had a bit more space for shelves so I added a bunch more because I could.

#### Beep Beep mf

I passed my driving test on the 20th of August (after a test two weeks earlier was cancelled with a couple of hours notice). I had 20 lessons over the course of two months, got a car the day after my test, but that [didn’t last long](https://rknight.me/blog/my-first-car-lasted-less-time-than-liz-truss-did-as-prime-minister/), and now I’m driving my wife’s old car. It's possible [my dream car from Hyundai](https://www.hyundai-n.com/en/models/rolling-lab/n-vision-74.do) might be a bit unattainable but fucking hell, just look at it.

### Writing

This post is my 130th blog post this year - more than double what I did last year. I've made an effort this year to move more towards [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) which means things that might have been a handful of toots before are now blog posts. I also have [my notes](/notes) which are a replacement for directly tooting on the 'don.

I also wrote a post [every day in May for WeblogPoMo](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/weblogpomo/) which I'm proud of. Not sure I can do that again though - it was a good excuse to clear out some drafts.

The most popular[^1] posts this year were:

- [Perplexity AI Is Lying about Their User Agent](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/)
- [Thinking About Recipe Formats More Than Anyone Should](https://rknight.me/blog/thinking-about-recipe-formats-more-than-anyone-should/)
- [Using the 8BitDo Keyboard on MacOS](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/)
- [Blocking Bots with Nginx](https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/)
- [The Web is Fantastic](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/)

### Enemy of Perplexity

In [June I noticed](https://rknight.me/notes/202406210759/) I had been mentioned in Perplexity's Wikipedia section titled "Use of content from media outlets" because of [this post](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/) and the [subsequent post on Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/). This has since expanded to become a proper "Controversies" section which I love and as [Jason so aptly put](https://mastodon.cc/@jgarber/112654776470729526):

> live every day like you might end up in some wretched company’s controversies section

Here it is as of today:

### Media

#### Movies

The only new movie I watched and liked this year was [Deadpool and Wolverine](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2024-07-25-deadpool--wolverine/). [Inside Out 2](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2024-09-29-inside-out-2/) lost whatever was good about the first one.

#### TV

[Fallout](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2024-06-14-fallout/) was a surprise; maybe we're in an era of _actually good_ games-to-tv-and-movies. Reacher season two was excellent, I'm hoping season three keeps it up.

The last [ever episode of The Grand Tour](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2024-09-17-the-grand-tour-one-for-the-road/) hit me harder than I thought it would. I've been watching Top Gear, and subsequently Grand Tour, since it started in 2002 which according to maths is 22 years. This led me down a rabbit hole of watching every special of both shows across a couple of weeks and every single one of them is such a joy. I am truly sad that they're not going to make any more. 

The [final episode of Gavin and Stacey](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2024-12-25-gavin-stacey-the-finale/) was perfect.

#### Music

Is is 2004 or 2024 because Green Day, Alkaline Trio, Sum 41, Eminem, The Offspring, Less Than Jake, Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, and Linkin Park all had new albums out this year. 

[Linkin Park's](https://musicthread.app/link/2osbHpeiWWq4ut3gbn15sgi7qMf) is easily my favourite one, Emily Armstrong was a fantastic choice. 

I found a couple of new artists this year. The first one was [Millie Manders](https://musicthread.app/link/2kKGdHJoNphrz5bk0XzKMbhZdtb) via [Lewis](https://lewisdale.dev) which I enjoyed so much I bought a hat from their store. The second was Ryan Oakes and his album [The Bootstrap Paradox](https://musicthread.app/link/2lYKv2JR3tncnVxdgIlkJAXjIQ5). I found him from, I think, a video that used [this track of his](https://musicthread.app/link/2lYRH5ef1Ma5bJMoZW1spFWH0fN) but I can't be 100% sure. The album is wall-to-wall bangers. I love it.

[A Whole New Sound](https://musicthread.app/link/2lgqMaxThQOcYnYXfHKmA9nHx02) has some good tracks but overall I was a bit disappointed with this.

My Musicthreads of tracks and albums for this year:

- [2024 Albums](https://musicthread.app/thread/2aN5K7DO9ffIo1pm9TfesGplQN8)
- [2024 Tracks](https://musicthread.app/thread/2aN5LAyzutLVuGQN60CllmFvE3r)
#### Games

Not much time for games, as usual, but I finished [Spider-Man 2](https://rknight.me/almanac/games/2024-01-14-spider-man-2/) at the start of the year and I'm pretty deep into Astro Bot at the moment. I also [briefly enjoyed Balatro](https://rknight.me/almanac/games/2024-12-31-balatro/) before retiring from it forever.

#### Books

lol okay nerd[^2].

#### Podcasts

I added the three new MacStories shows to my subscriptions -  [Magic Rays of Light](https://www.macstories.net/magic-rays-of-light/), [NPC](https://macstories.net/npc), and [Comfort Zone](https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/) even if I don't have the time to listen to every episode.

I was also a guest on two podcasts this year:

- [AppStories 412](https://appstories.net/episodes/412): _What Kind of Person Are You?_ in which Viticci accused me of giving off linux person vibes. [My blog post about it](https://rknight.me/blog/i-was-a-guest-on-appstories-this-week/).
- [Conduit 91](https://www.relay.fm/conduit): _Robb Knight made this for himself, and maybe you too._. Jay asked me a bunch of questions and was far too nice to me and I didn't know what to do. [My blog post is here](https://rknight.me/blog/i-was-a-guest-on-conduit/).

### Side Projects and Freelance

Despite attending a freelancers meetup every month for a decade, I've never done any freelance work until this year. 

#### KnightShift and MacStories

In January I started working for MacStories doing work to bring new features and [new podcasts](https://macstories.net/podcasts) to the site. One of those new shows was my own, [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com). Along with [Magic Rays of Light](https://www.macstories.net/magic-rays-of-light/), [NPC](https://macstories.net/npc), and [Comfort Zone](https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/) we have quite a little gang of pods over there now.

Even though I'm a sole trader, I still had to get a business domain because I love a new domain name so I got [knightshift.dev](https://knightshift.dev). I only recently cleaned it up to highlight my freelance things but it's there.

#### EchoFeed

In last year's post I said "_I have plans to make Echo a more user-friendly project_" and in April [I launched EchoFeed](https://rknight.me/blog/echofeed/). The first couple of months were interesting. I fucked up a migration to a new feed-fetching system and sent 500 posts in the space of an hour or so, then I kept having issues of the server crapping out at random. But that's all sorted now.

Overall it's been successful and people seem to like it, especially [Amplify](https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify) which boosts posts sent with EchoFeed. There's been a bunch of [changes and new features](https://help.echofeed.app/changelog/) added and [I'm working on some fun stuff](https://news.echofeed.app/echofeed-updates/) for it.

#### Other Projects

A lot less projects shipped this year mostly because of freelancing and focusing on EchoFeed but the ones I did ship I'm pretty happy with.

[Humonize!](https://hum.rknight.me/) came about because of humonising on [Connected](https://relay.fm/connected) and they were gunna stop because someone hated it so I made this. I honestly can't keep track of the lore. Also it has tiny head mode.

[Perfect Albums](https://albums.rknight.me/) is a similar project to [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) showcasing people's perfect albums based on the question asked on episode [110 of Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/110). Speaking of App Defaults, it's come around again with people posting their 2024 edition so it's gone well over 400 blog posts now.

The hastily put together collab between myself, Sara, and Keenan: [Everyone's Free (to Make Websites)](https://rknight.me/blog/everybodys-free-to-make-websites/).

[Slash Pages](https://slashpages.net/) is the only project I bought a domain for, it just felt like it needed one. It started off with a handful and now it has over 30 different slash pages.

[Lens](https://lens.rknight.me) is a project I've been meaning to do for a long time. It checks meta tags, icons, and RSS auto-discovery - basically a check for right before I launch a site. Also handy for checking preview images.

[EmojiStorm](https://emojistorm.rknight.me/) came to me while I was messing around with [`snow-fall`](https://www.zachleat.com/web/snow-fall/). It's a bit chaotic.

During the recording of my appearance on Conduit, Jay joked that I should make a site to show the last time I'd watched Mean Girls. [So I did just that](https://meangirls.rknight.me).

#### The Donation Daddy Returns

September is, as always, childhood cancer awareness month so me and [Adam](https://neatnik.net/) were fundraising again. We blew past last year's amount and [raised over twenty thousand dollars](https://tiltify.com/@rknightuk/stjude2024) which is incredible. We added a St Jude theme to omg.lol which you can see on our [St Jude account here](https://stjude.omg.lol/) and of course we had some wonderful stickers again.

![Ruminate and Party Prami stickers](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/st-jude-2024-stickers.jpg)

While I was [in London for Relay 10](https://rknight.me/almanac/events/2024-07-27-relay-10/) I got the chance to meet Jill and others from St Jude at a lunch they had put on which was a lovely thing to be invited to.

I won a [Mark One pen](https://rknight.me/blog/mark-one-enigma-edition-pen-review/) for donating to Engima stationery's campaign which is far too fancy a pen for me but I love it.

Not sure what we're going to do next year to be honest but we might as well start thinking about it, it's [basically September](https://isitseptember.fyi/).

#### Miscellanea

- I moved [my wiki](/intersect) to this site
- [Almanac](/almanac) now has posters
- I built a CMS for my site
- I [added recipe support to my site](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/recipes/)
- I quit smoking in November. `Health++`, `Cool--`.

[^1]: I've excluded [this one](https://rknight.me/convert-spotify-facebook-to-email-login/) because although it's popular it's boring as fuck. At least [this one](https://rknight.me/create-a-blank-no-header-markdown-table/) has dropped off the top slots now.
[^2]: I still have the same four half-finished books on my shelf, leave me alone
