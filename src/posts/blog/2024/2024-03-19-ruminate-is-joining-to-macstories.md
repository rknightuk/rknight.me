I can't find the original tweet, nor do I know which one of us sent it, but some time in the summer of 2015 either John or I sent the other a tweet that said "We should start a podcast" and [Ruminate](https://rumimatepodcast.com) was born (after quite a few never-to-be-published "pilot" episodes).

Over those seven years we've published 180 episodes and covered all kinds of topics starting with [the burger crust pizza](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/02/pizza-hut-2880-calorie-monstrosity-worlds-burgeoning-food-crisis) on the [first episode](https://ruminatepodcast.com/1/) all the way to now where John [got spicy about Arc and AI](https://ruminatepodcast.com/179/). We've encouraged each to buy stupid stuff and eat terrible food. Mostly we've had a lot of fun. In my [announcement blog post](https://rknight.me/blog/ruminate-podcast/) I said:

> we'll be talking about how technology helps solve problems, as well as some non-tech related topics like terrible food

I think we nailed it.

As of today, Ruminate is part of [MacStories](https://macstories.net/ruminate) but the show isn't changing. We'll still talk about [KFC crocs](https://www.crocs.com/KFC.html), [spicy crisps](https://www.panchosburritos.co.uk/product/takis-crisps/), and anything else we can think of. We _will_ be sticking to the schedule better though. If you're already subscribed you don't need do anything. If you've not listened before, now is a great time to jump in - all the links you need are on the [Ruminate website](https://ruminatepodcast.com) and the dedicated [page on MacStories](https://macstories.net/ruminate). John also [wrote a post about it here](https://www.macstories.net/news/ruminate-joins-macstories).
