While watching [this video about making wine from Monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qo9OV9iqebc)[^1] this morning and thinking about how I want nothing more than to try it, I wondered how this would do as a replacement for the energy drink portion of The Robb Jobb. What is the Robb Jobb? Good question, smart reader. The Robb Jobb is a punch of my own design that I have made on a handful of occasions over the past decade, the last time at my stag do in 2020. Each time everyone says it's delicious and then choas ensues.

"_Robb I wanna make this right now, give me the recipe_". Okay, calm down. As with all good recipes, it has one instruction: mix all this together. Ideally served from a bucket or comically large punch bowl with a ladel.

- 2 litres of vodka.
- 1 litre of energy drink. I've used [Tesco Blue Spark](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/314819928) in the past for this but pick any energy drink you fancy. Or make it with Monster wine and let me know how it goes.
- 500ml of lager. Heineken is my preference for this.
- 100ml of lime cordial.

I take no responsibility for what happens if you make or drink this. It _is_ delecious though.

[^1]: It has to be made in the Monster region, otherwise it's just sparkling energy wine.
