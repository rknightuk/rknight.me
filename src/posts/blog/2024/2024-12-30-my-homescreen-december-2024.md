Since I [last shared my home screen](https://rknight.me/blog/my-home-screen-january-2024/) at the start of the year, iOS18 added dark mode icons which I immediately switched on. I still have a couple of apps that haven't updated but I need them on my home screen so I just live with it. 

Other changes:

- I'm back on Reddit but only reading, not posting
- I'm using [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) instead of Omnivore (which has shut down anyway)
- [Godspeed](https://godspeedapp.com/a/RKNIGHT25) is where I'm doing most of my reminders and todo lists now
