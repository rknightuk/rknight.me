excerpt: "TikTok uses unique links to track who's watched a video and THEN notifies the sharer about who's watched it"

Today a friend shared a video on TikTok with me that I promptly sent to my wife because I knew she would find it funny. [It is funny](https://www.tiktok.com/@wonderbaby.co/video/7390445129993096478) (this is a non-tracked link). A few hours later that friend said "Oh your wife has watched it" because TikTok notified him, with her username, that she had watched it. What the actual fuck. 

Every time you share a link to a TikTok from the app, it generates a new link. There is no way that I can find to get a canonical share link to a video. `https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdJQnqXX/` and `https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdJ41RXX/` are links to the exact same video (redacted for obvious reasons) but one is linked to my friend and one is linked to me.

Look at this fucking notification:

I'm sure none of this is new information but I don't use TikTok so haven't been paying attention but I swear to god I'm never opening a TikTok link ever again.
