Three months ago I [wrote about using the Johnny Decimal System](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-johnny-decimal-system/) - a system to organise your files, emails, and everything else in a way that means things are findable and storable quickly. 

I had assumed, like a lot of things I try, that given a month or so I'd be back to just dumping files wherever and being annoyed when I couldn't find things but to my surprise the system is working. _Really well_. If I download a podcast episode I'm mentioned in[^1] I know it goes in `20-29 Podcasts > 22 Follow Out > 22.02 Podcast Mentions`, that gifs go in `50-59 Media > 54 Memes > 54.02 Gifs`, and my payslips go in `10-19 Home and Family > 13 Legal > 13.05 Payslips`. I can find these quickly regardless of if I use terminal, Finder, or Alfred's `find` command.

I still have a fairly substantial downloads folder filled with random things but every now and again I can go through, delete what I don't need, and file everything else in the right place. I've also stuck with keeping [my index](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.05-the-index/) in Obsidian where I've been keeping it up-to-date with related notes about my files.

This might be the first time a new system, of any kind, has actually clicked for me. [The workbook](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.02-the-decimal-workbook/), which I highly recommend, is only $19 now if you think this is something you want to try. And as if we planned this (we definitely didn't), just as I was about to publish this post Johnny announced [the workshop](https://jdcm.al/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.03-the-decimal-workshop/) which has a pre-launch price of $49.
