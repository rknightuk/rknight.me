Computers are not my friend this week and I am basically ready to throw my computer into the sea. Here is an incomplete list of things annoying me at the moment:

- Discord not marking a channel as read no matter how many times I look at it. Only force quitting fixes it. 
- Open source projects that say they’re “Built with Docker” with no other information about the stack meaning I have to go hunting in the code base just to find out how it’s actually built and if it’s something I’d be willing to maintain/fix if I decide to use it. This is like saying my house is “built with foundations”. 
- The fact that I’m forced to use Instagram’s shitty app to see my friend’s photos. 
- The share sheet on Apple Music on my Mac stops working at least once a day meaning I have to quit and restart it just to copy a link to an album or track. 
- Apple’s stupid EU DMA proposals. If what they’ve proposed gets accepted by the EU the DMA is a waste of time and they might as well not have bothered with it in the first place. Third party app stores except Apple still controls the whole thing? I can’t even. 
- Notifications on my wife’s Apple Watch have just stopped working for almost every app. I’ve tried everything and nothing fixes it.
