    >> name: Mango Chicken Curry

    >> notes: The recipe calls for fresh ginger but I'm lazy and use ginger paste instead | The mango can be fresh or frozen, it makes very little difference

    Saut√© the @Chopped Onion{1} and @Cauliflour{120%g} in a pan for ~{2-3%minutes} until softened.

    Add the @Garlic{3%cloves}, @Curry Powder{30%g}, @Tomato Puree{30%g}, and @Ginger{15%g} for ~{1-2 minutes} while stirring.

    Put it in a blender, add half the @Mango{60%g} and @Coconut Milk{400%ml}, then blend until smooth.

    Put the sauce back in the pan, bring it to a simmer, then add @Diced Chicken Breast{600%g} and simmer for ~{10-15%minutes} until the chicken is cooked. Stir occasionally.

    Finally, stir in the rest of the mango.

As promised [last week](https://rknight.me/blog/adding-cooklang-support-to-eleventy-two-ways/), this week is recipe week. 

This is one we batch cook for Baby Knight every few weeks and she can't get enough of it. The last batch I didn't have any tomato puree but I went ahead with it anyway and she still enjoyed it.
