If you prefer listening to reading, I spoke to John about this on [Ruminate 183](https://ruminatepodcast.com/183).

I have used [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) for about nine years. In that time I've come to rely on it for almost everything I do on my Mac - [snippets](https://rknight.me/blog/snippets-i-use-regularly/), clipboard history, finding files, and [numerous custom workflows](/alfred-workflows).

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) is the new(ish) launcher all the cool kids are using. Off the bat, it has a much nicer UI than Alfred and a lot more options in terms of what it can show in it's window like checkboxes for ticking of reminders. I've clung onto Alfred since Raycast launched but after seeing [Laker](https://laker.tech) use it to add a reminder on a stream, I've been wanting to try it out.

Reminders and calendars is something I attempted to make a workflow for in Alfred and it did _work_, but it didn't work well. I just don't believe Alfred has the right UI options to be able to do it really well. I think Alfred hasn't improved enough in terms of what it can do in recent years and Raycast is the clear choice for anyone new wanting to try a launcher.
### The Experiment

I've installed Raycast and set it to open with <kbd>⌃ + space</kbd> which I previously used for Alfred (Alfred is now set to <kbd>⌥ + space</kbd>) and over the next few weeks I'm going to see how much of what I use in Alfred I can get done with Raycast.

So what do I actually _do_ with Alfred? Starting with the built in features that I know Raycast can already do:

- Clipboard manager. Raycast has this. Bonus: it allows filtering by type: text, images, colors, files, and links. This is really nice.
- File search: In my brief testing this works as well as Alfred.
- Snippets: Raycast has it. [This script](https://thewang.net/en/blog/Migrate-Alfred-Snippets-to-Raycast/) worked perfectly for importing my Alfred ones. It's a shame I can't group them like I can on Alfred.
- Run shortcuts: I currently do this with a workflow in Alfred but Raycast has this built in.
- Bookmark search: Solved with an extension.
- Emoji picker: Again, Raycast has this built in.

My first thoughts after doing this first part is that Raycast feels much nicer: everything is snappier and smoother than Alfred. Things just look better.

The second part of this is workflows, mostly ones I've made. Can I make something like my [toggle workflow](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/toggle-utils) as easily as I can in Alfred? What about [QuickNote](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/quicknote)? Making workflows for little things I want is a big part of why I use Alfred. I'll be back with part 2 once I've dug into this some more.
