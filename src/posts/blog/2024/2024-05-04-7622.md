Settle in and get comfy kids, time to tell you the tale of [T9 predictive text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)). We didn't always have a full QWERTY keyboard to type on. T9 was how we typed messages on our dumb phones back in the early 2000s. T9 stands for "typing on 9 keys". Here is a Nokia 3210 and it's glorious buttons. Note the letters on the number keys:

To type the word "help" you would press 4357. To type "me" you would press 63. To type "home" you would press 4663 but that could also be "gone", or "hood". I found out just now that these are called "[textonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_text#Textonyms)"; "_words produced by the same combination of keypresses_". 

I had, for as long as I had the function to choose to, shortened my "real"[^1] name from Robert to Rob, with one "B". Back in 2004 when using my Nokia 3210 if I wanted to type "Rob" I would press 762. Except, for reasons unknown to me, the default dictionary on these phones would _always_ pick "soc" when pressing 762. So I'd have to press the arrow key to get it to switch to "Rob". In theory, T9 had a user dictionary and should remember these changes for next time it suggests a word but it didn't. Not on any of the phones I'd had up until that point so there was only one solution.

**I added another B.** 7622. Robb. Genius. Worked every time. I remember this day so clearly, feeling like I'd beaten the system somehow. I had defeated the T9 final boss. I immediately changed my Faceparty profile (not a joke, Faceparty was a legit social network) to the new spelling and I used that spelling for everything from then on - work, college, banking, everything. Technically I couldn't prove that was my name because my passport still had "Robert" on it. Up until 2019 when I [changed my name by deed poll](https://rknight.me/blog/changing-your-name-by-deed-poll/) and made Robb the "real" spelling of my name (along with changing my surname).

So there you go. I did it because I didn't want to move my thumb _ever so slightly up and to the right_ to press the arrow key.
