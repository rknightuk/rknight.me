    >> notes: I much prefer a flatbread to a crunchy tostada or taco so that's what I have this with. I like [these Deli Kitchen ones](https://mydelikitchen.co.uk/products/4-greek-style-flatbreads/). | The original recipe calls for sour cream whisked with lime but who has the time. Sour cream on its own is fine. | I use a couple of teaspoons of pre-chopped garlic instead of slicing my own.

    Pre-heat the oven to 200°c/400°f.

    Lay out @Chicken Thighs{1.2%kg} on a sheet tray. Generously salt both sides and roast in the oven for ~{25%minutes}.

    Add a @Oil, @Chopped Onion{1}, @Sliced Garlic{3%cloves}, and @Salt to a pan and fry on medium heat for ~{5%minutes}.

    Add @Tomato Puree{25%g} to the pan, mix, and fry for ~{2-3%minutes}.

    Add @Sun-Dried Tomatoes/Fire Roasted Peppers{400%g}, @Large Chopped Tomatoes{2}, @Chicken Stock{200%g}, and @Chipotle Paste{50%g} to the pan. Simmer for ~{10-15%minutes} until it's thickened a bit and the fresh tomatoes are cooked through. 

    Stir in @Salt{5%g} and @Apple Cider Vinegar{20%g} then blend with an #Immersion Blender{} until smooth.

    Shred the chicken by hand then mix it with the sauce.

    Lightly grill the @Flatbreads{}, add a tablespoon of the chicken tinga to each flatbread, add some chopped @Little Gem Lettuce{}, and drizzle with @Sour Cream{}.

I haven't stopped thinking about this recipe since I [made it for the first time last week](https://rknight.me/notes/202412020911/). It's from [Brian Lagerstrom](https://www.brianlagerstrom.com/recipes/chicken-tinga?rq=tinga) who is my favourite YouTube chef person. I've modified the recipe in a few different ways but it's mostly the same as his if you want to watch a video of it instead, he's got you covered.

I'm using store-bought flatbreads for this which are lovely, but I'd love to find to find a nice, easy, flatbread recipe. If someone has one, let me know.
