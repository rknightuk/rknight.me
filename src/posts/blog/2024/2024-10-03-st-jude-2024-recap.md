Relay's St Jude campaign for 2024 is (mostly) over and they raised over _one million dollars_, which is incredible. This year for our campaign, me and Adam set our goal to one cent over last year's final total: $12,590.57. Given that last year $5k of that was from a one-off donation it seemed reasonable to try and aim for that. We never expected to hit $10k on the 4th of September, then hit the goal six days later, and _then_ keep going all the way to $20k on the ~~1st of October~~ 31st of September. Thank to you everyone who donated or shared the campaign.

You can read all about the stickers [in my previous post](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2024/) but we have 84 sticker packs going out to 16 different countries. 

The [Donation Daddy extended universe](https://donationdaddy.rknight.me) was resurrected for this year's campaign and got a new friend: [Hat Help](https://hathelp.rknight.me). Anyone who raised over $500 this year gets a very natty hat and tumbler.

During the campaign I received 3 pins from Tiltify to celebrate raising $7.5k, $10k, and $25k which was lovely.

### Donation Treats

There were 92 incentives available across 179 campaigns. I've got a coaster coming from [MVO](https://mvo.live), mine and Baby Knight's name will be on the cart he's building, I entered some raffles for various things, got some stickers, and I took full advantage of [JD's roasts](https://tiltify.com/@jd-burch/jd-burch-for-st-judes-2024?origin=dashboard) and bought two: one for my new car and one for my desk.
#### Car Roast

> Oh, look at this little Hyundai i30. You really decided to go full in on the mediocre route, didn’t you? This car is the equivalent of the lukewarm cup of keurig coffee you had at their dealership. It looks like they designed it with the ruler and severe lack of ambition combo. I mean, it’s got four wheels and an engine, but so does my lawnmower. 
>
> I bet stepping on the gas in this thing feels like asking grandma to hurry up. "Okay, okay, we’re going, don’t rush me!” You want something fun to zip around in? You’ll have to find it elsewhere because this car is about as thrilling as a PowerPoint presentation on spreadsheets. This thing is so basic, it’s probably invisible to radar, because even technology can’t be bothered to notice it. 
> 
> But at least it’s reliable, right? Because when you’re driving something that looks like it was designed by committee, you need something to cling to. So yeah, enjoy your Hyundai i30—because someone has to, right?

#### Desk Roast

> Robb, this desk seriously looks like the chaotic tribute to the art of procrastination. Let’s start with the pegboard: Clearly it’s supposed to be an organizational tool, but it looks like it’s been hit by a mini-tornado of random trinkets and plants. Do those succulents even get sunlight? Or are they just there to distract you from the existential crisis that is your organizational state? Do they help absorb the overwhelming amount of “I’ll get to it later” vibes in the air? I have to say, though, the groot is a very good addition.
> 
> I have been instructed to roast, but we cannot let the fantastic desk mat go unnoticed. It’s quite unfortunate that it’s going to be replaced soon. 
> 
> Three cans of Monster? Clearly caffeine is your only fuel source as you try to survive yet another round of scrolling through Slack pretending to be busy. Do those empty cans just live there permanently, like a memorial to all the sleep you’ll never get back thanks to Baby Knight? 
> 
> There’s just a random assortment of everything. There’s a pink microphone, a half open drawer, a fan (That does not appear to be Ryobi 👀), and a whole bunch of random objects. This desk is a chaos where minimalism went to die, and then your productivity followed right after. 
> 
> What’s up with the cool action figure/lego/something figure in the top right? That thing looks like the guardian of your desk. It will defend it with its life, eliminating anyone who tries to throw away your monster cans. 
> 
> In conclusion, your background screams that you want to be organized but also embrace chaos, and it’s giving off major creative meltdown in progress vibes. You’ve somehow managed to turn a pegboard into a shrine for random knick-knacks and, of course, that one succulent that’s definitely judging you from a distance.

Plans are already starting for next year, so look out for that. It's basically September already.
