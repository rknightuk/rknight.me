Apologies for the terrible filtered photos but the only versions I have are from my Instagram archive when we all thought filters were the best thing ever. They were not.

My first Mac was a 2009 27” iMac. It was a Christmas present from my parents. I had asked for a Mac Mini so a iMac was a big upgrade. I asked for the mini partly because it was cheaper and partly because I already had a (really crappy) monitor. I think it technically belonged to my dad’s company for _tax reasons_ and I _did_ do some work for him at least once so all good Mr tax man, nothing to see here. 

Having been on hand-me-down crappy Windows laptops prior to the iMac I was blown away. The screen, the OS in general, and the third party apps. In particular, Panic’s Coda is the one I remember the most - I even used their font for my HTML and CSS tattoos.

That iMac lasted me a long time as both my general computer and my “TV”. Then a few years in the hard drive failed which meant I had to take it apart and replace the drive. If you don’t know, to get to anything in one of these iMacs, you need to get the glass off the front, ideally with specialised tools that I didn’t have, so I used a toilet plunger instead[^1].

Another fun thing about this; the hard drives in these iMac also include temperature sensors. At the time, I couldn’t afford one with the sensor so I installed a normal drive and then used a third party app called something like “fan control pro”. When it booted up and the app wasn’t running, the fans would run on full until the app launched. Good times. 

The iMac got retired when I bought a real TV like a grown up and the Mac itself was replaced with a MacBook Air and since then a series of MacBook Pros. You can see my current setup on [my uses page](/uses).

These days I still love my Mac but I’m not so enamoured with the company but that’s a post for another day.
