It's been just over a year since [Dual of the Defaults](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) burst into our lives and my time was consumed by [tracking nearly 400 blog posts](https://defaults.rknight.me). Rather than write out [last years list again](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults/), here's what has changed since then:

**To-Do**: I'm all in on [Godspeed](https://godspeedapp.com/a/RKNIGHT25). Reminders is just a bit...annoying?

**RSS**: Self-hosted [Miniflux](https://rknight.me/blog/using-miniflux-with-reeder-and-netnewswire/) with [Reeder Classic](https://reederapp.com/classic/) on iOS and [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) on the Mac. Reeder is new because it has a dark icon, NetNewsWire doesn't right now.

**Bookmarks**: Self-hosted [LinkAce](https://links.rknight.me/dashboard).

**Read-it-Later**: Raindrop. Ominvore as it happens is now gone but I switched a while ago.

**News**: I'm still using Mastodon but on the advice of [Johnny](https://johnnydecimal.com), BBC news is gone from my home screen.
