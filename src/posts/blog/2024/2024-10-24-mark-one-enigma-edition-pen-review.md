During September I donated to Enigma Stationery's campaign and was entered into a raffle to win the [Mark One Enigma Edition](https://enigmastationery.com/shop/p/mark-one-enigma-edition) and...I actually won! I've never owned a fancy pen[^1], especially not one this pretty. I don't even write with pen and paper all that much. None of my notebooks have good paper, or quality covers, or fold out flat but I'm gunna review it anyway.

The Mark One is a pen by [Studio Neat](https://www.studioneat.com/products/markone) who make lots of lovely things. The Enigma edition features "_a three-layer exterior coating with sparkling teal on a black background_". It feels great in the hand and the clicking mechanism is very satisfying. For ink it takes a Schmidt capless refill which, to my untrained eye, appears to be some kind of ink container. The one that came with mine definitely has ink. I made this natty diagram to help explain:

When I started writing this post I wanted to parody a pen review like the ones Brad does over on [The Pen Addict](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2018/3/26/mark-one-pen-review) but I truly know so little about pens that I can't do it. Anyway, it is a lovely pen and I'm now finding myself looking at decent notebooks, the [mark one pen tray](https://www.studioneat.com/products/pentray), and _other nice pens_.
