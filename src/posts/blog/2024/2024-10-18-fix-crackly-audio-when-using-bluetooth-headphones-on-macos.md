Every now and again I start listening to music on MacOS through my headphones and the audio is tinny and crackly. After some dicking around with quitting Apple Music, reconnecting the headphones, even rebooting the Mac nothing fixed it. I finally worked out the fix[^1] - changing the input settings of the Mac to _not_ be the headphones. No more crackling.

Yet another [very stupid fix for stupid audio issues](https://rknight.me/blog/fix-for-bluetooth-audio-cutting-out-on-the-mac/).
