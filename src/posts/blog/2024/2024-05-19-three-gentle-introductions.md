An excellent idea from [Merlin Mann](https://merlin.ghost.io/gentle-introductions/):

> the idea is to see if I can get somebody interested in a band I love (or sometimes even one specific aspect of a band I love) by curating a playlist of seven **_and only seven_** songs
> 
> [...]
> 
> Just seven really good songs that might help you fall in love too.

I enjoy the "essentials" playlists that Apple Music does but they tend to just be "here's the 10 or so most popular songs by this artist". More often than not, if you _love_ a band, their most popular songs won't be the "best" ones. At least for me that's the case.

So I thought I'd do some for artists I love. I had a look through my [top 50 artists](https://rknight.me/blog/100-best-albums-robbs-version/) to find some interesting ones - I don't think anyone needs me to do an intro to Linkin Park or Eminem. And because I'm a good egg, each playlist is on Apple Music, Spotify, and MusicThread.
