Ten days ago, I passed my driving test and my dad was kind enough to give me my mum's old car: a 2011 Smart Fortwo. The plan was I would drive this for a few months before Baby Knight Two is born, then we'd trade it in and get something bigger and I would take my wife's car.

It's a weird car. It's much bigger inside than you'd assume, the boot is as small as you'd imagine, the wheels are _tiny_ so you feel every bump, and it's automatic but not a good automatic. Every gear change is really clunky. But it _is_ kinda fun to drive.

Part of the rush for me to pass my driving test was to drive Baby Knight the first to her grandparents once a week so my wife didn't have to do it ridiculously early. I needed to disable the front passenger airbag so I could put Baby Knight in there so I consulted the manual and it seemed easy: pop your key in this switch, turn it off. Except I had no switch - after a lot of googling around it turns out the switch I wanted was _an optional extra_ that the person who bought it new decided to not purchase. I _could_ have bodged it to turn it off but from what I read I would need to get Mercedes to recode the car (whatever that means) if I wanted to enable it again.

Baby Knight starts nursery this week so we ramped up our timeline and bought a new car which we picked up today and handed over the Smart car as a deposit. Ten days it lasted.

Bye Felicia.
