Following on from my [two](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-one/) [posts](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-two/) about Raycast, I got some feedback about some things that I missed.

[Dean pointed out](https://twit.social/@deanfx/112490686592546100) that my scripts to open common folders were unnecessary because Raycast has a [Quicklinks](https://www.raycast.com/extensions/quicklinks) extension which can be used to open files, folders, and websites.

He also mentioned something else Raycast has that I didn't realise: a search screenshots extension. This searches your screenshots folder so you can copy one to the clipboard as well as extract the text.

And finally [Dave pointed me](https://mastodon.social/@davepowers/112493742867841720) to the [soundboard extension](https://www.raycast.com/pernielsentikaer/soundboard) which I could use for my Brian Butterfield soundboard.
