Time for Link Dump #2. Lots of interesting links and not enough time to post them all separately. Here we go:

- [Organic Software Directory](https://built.organic/) - This is fun. A bit quiet right now but I'll be keeping an eye on it.
- [Using Gitea/Github actions for triggering Echo](https://lewisdale.dev/post/using-gitea-github-actions-for-triggering-echo/) - Lewis is running [Echo](https://echo.rknight.me) on GitHub actions and wrote about it. [He might not need to do this for much longer ðŸ‘€](https://echofeed.app)
- [I archived my tweets](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/i-archived-my-tweets/) - Lynn did a great job here making her archive look like the Twitter site. 
- [pngdraw](https://png-draw.replit.app/) - Use any image as a brush
- [I Just Want a Nice Browser!](https://havn.blog/2024/03/11/i-just-want.html) - Don't we all.
- [JSON Canvas â€” An open file format for infinite canvas data.](https://jsoncanvas.org/) - Obsidian have released a spec for their canvas format.
- [Doing weeknotes](https://doingweeknotes.com/) - I've been meaning to try doing some weeknotes and this is a great collection of notes and articles about it.
- [About Ideas Now](https://aboutideasnow.com/) - This is cool. I need to add an `/ideas` page

Some new fonts I've discovered:

- [Shantell Sans](https://shantellsans.com/) - I need to use this _somewhere_. I love it. 
- Same with [Lauren Herda's Achieve](https://www.herda.me/work/achieve)
- [andirueckel/undefined-medium](https://github.com/andirueckel/undefined-medium)

And some web dev related things:

- [Basic Dialog Usage and Gotchas To Watch For](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/basic-dialog-usage-and-gotchas-to-watch-for/) - The `dialog` element is great but it's easy to use it wrong.
- [Why smol images are better](https://mostlypixels.com/webdesign/2023/12/15/smol-images)
- [An HTML Switch Control](https://webkit.org/blog/15054/an-html-switch-control/) - Details on the new UI for checkboxes in Safari 17.4

All of these are archived in [my LinkAce](https://links.rknight.me/).
