It’s well known how much I love Back to the Future so I was excited to see The Incomparable cover Back to the Future the past three episodes. Back in 2011 they did [a single episode for all three movies](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/41/) which, as Jason noted, is not nearly enough time to _really_ discuss these movies.

- [Part I - Kramer Before Kramer](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/704/)
- [Part II - A Legacy of Biffs](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/705/)
- [Part III - Riff on Biff](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/706/)

I agree with a lot of the criticism against the second movie especially in regards to Jennifer. I can’t find a source now, it might be one of the bonus DVD features, but Bob Gale admitted that if they’d known they would do a sequel to the first movie they would never have put Jennifer in the car on the way to the future. That doesn’t excuse the crapping of her but it at least explains why it’s like it is. 

The [animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_(TV_series)) was also mentioned as something worth watching and I agree but I’d also say the [IDW comics](https://backtothefuture.fandom.com/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_comics) are worth reading for fans of the movies. There’s some great back story (Doc was part of the Manhattan Project, for example) and it fills in a lot of what went on in the alternate 1985 before Doc and Marty show up like the death of George McFly. 

I constantly flip-flop between which is my favourite but after listening to these, despite the criticism, I still think part two is my favourite of the three; I’m a sucker for revisiting previous scenes (or in this case the previous movie).
