I was tagged by [Kyle](https://weblog.kylereddoch.me/2025/01/blog-question-challenge-2025) and [B](https://blog.binarydigit.city/posts/blog-question-challenge-2025) to do this so here it is.

**_Why Did You Start Blogging In The First Place?_**

Initially I thought I'd be some hot take blogger getting posts retweeted by loads of people and be popular or something. We all wanted to be Gruber back then.

More recently I'm blogging for me. It's [recipes](/blog/tags/recipes), technical posts, things I've solved, ideas I've had. Basically instructions for anything I, or someone else, might want to do.

**_What Platform Are You Using The Manage Your Blog, And Why Do You Use It?_**

My site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). In theory, that means it's just a bunch of markdown files. In practice, it's markdown files, JSON files, javascript files, plus my [custom CMS](http://github.com/rknightuk/knightcms). I use it because it gives me the flexibility to make my site do exactly what I want.

**_Have You Blogged On Other Platforms Before?_**

I started on hosted Wordpress many years ago, then self-hosted Wordpress, then Jekyll, then Hugo, then Hexo, and now Eleventy.


**_How Do You Write Your Posts?_**

Usually I write a draft in Obsidian then copy it over into VSCode and publish. For shorter posts, or [my notes](/notes), I write those directly into the CMS which pushes them to the GitHub repository. I wrote [more in depth about this here](https://rknight.me/blog/my-blogging-workflow/).

**_When Do You Feel Most Inspired To Write?_**

There are two main times I feel inspired:

- When I've solved a problem and I want to document the solution
- When I feel myself thinking about writing a thread of toots

**_Do You Normally Publish Immediately After Writing, Or Do You Let It Simmer?_**

I rarely let them simmer, I just send them out into the world so the typos can reveal themselves.

**_Whatâ€™s Your Favorite Post On Your Blog?_**

The sensible answer is [7622 - why I spell my name with two Bs](https://rknight.me/blog/7622/) but this [sleep-deprived ramble about the fruits of Hey Bear](https://rknight.me/blog/biology-of-hey-bear-fruits/) is definitely up there.

**_Any Future Plans For the Blog?_**

I have a list longer than you can imagine but next up is some more work on [transient slash pages](https://rknight.me/blog/on-transient-slash-pages/).


**_Who Will Participate Next?_**

[Keenan, please](https://gkeenan.co).
