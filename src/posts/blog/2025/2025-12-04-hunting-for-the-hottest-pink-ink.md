When I was [on The Pen Addict](https://rknight.me/blog/i-was-a-guest-on-the-pen-addict-689/) a few weeks ago, I mentioned I was looking for the hottest pink ink the world has to offer to go with my [Estie Funky Town](https://www.esterbrookpens.com/products/funky-town-estie?variant=47785259434234). I got loads of suggestions and I eventually stumbled on an ink that I think is perfect for what I wanted - [Octopus Fluids Neon Pink](https://www.octopus-office.de/shop/en/creative-inks/fountain-pen-ink-writing-ink/highlighter-neon-inks/7759/highlighter-ink-for-fountain-pens-fluorescent-neon-pink-30-ml?c=4679). 

I ordered a bunch of inks during Black Friday day/week/month and Ben sent me a sample of [Robert Oster Hot Pink](https://mountainofink.com/blog/robert-oster-hot-pink). It wasn't until after I got all these inks that I _then_ realised I already owned a very similar ink that was also what I was looking for, [Diamine Hope Pink](https://mountainofink.com/blog/diamine-hope-pink), but I had misremembered and didn't think it was as bright as it was. Some of these I knew wouldn't be the winner but I wanted anyway because they're nice colours - Wearingeul Cheshire Cat for example. Nevertheless, here's the samples:

There are more than I don't have from the suggestions including: 

- [Pilot Iroshizuku Tsutsuji](https://mountainofink.com/blog/pilot-iroshizuku-tsutsuji) which Brad is sending me a sample of
- [Diamine Pink Glitz](https://mountainofink.com/blog/diamine-pink-glitz)
- [Lamy Rhodonite](https://mountainofink.com/blog/lamy-rhodonite)
- [Sailor Ink Studio 431 and 731](https://mountainofink.com/blog/sailor-ink-studio-set3)
- [Colorverse Las Vegas](https://vanness1938.com/en-gb/products/colorverse-usa-special-series-ink-nevada-fabulous-las-vegas?srsltid=AfmBOortJ1E78ZumSw4kqER06LvjcIs_Z9IrsFER9IYpCtq7LYaETOe1)

There are a shedload of lovely pinks and purples here (and in general, [look at this list on Mountain of Ink](https://mountainofink.com/blog/pink-ink)) and I can see myself using all of the ones I bought at different times. Although Hope Pink and Neon Pink look similar in the sample, Neon Pink definitely has a slight edge over the Diamine for me but I suspect if they weren't next to each other I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
