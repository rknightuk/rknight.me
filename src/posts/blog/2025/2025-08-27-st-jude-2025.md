tl;dr:Â [Donate to our campaign here](https://stjude.omg.lol/)

For the [third](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2023) [year](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2024/) me and [Adam](https://neatnik.net) are raising money for St Jude as part of [Relay's annual event and podcastathon](https://relay.experience.stjude.org/). You can read [Stephen's post about it here](https://512pixels.net/2025/08/st-jude-2025/).

This year, we've set our goal at $16,850.80 which will put us at $50k lifetime raised. Our previous final totals were $12,590.57 and $20,558.63 so that goal is definitely within reach.

To help us reach our goal for just $20 you can donate, help kids with cancer, and we'll send you a pair of exclusive Ruminate and omg.lol stickers which will be revealed at $1500 and $3000 raised.

You can also show your support by using the St Jude theme on your [omg.lol profile](https://omg.lol) and keep an eye on [bids.lol](https://bids.lol) for some lifetime addresses and other goodies. 

The [Donation Daddy](https://donationdaddy.rknight.me) website has been completely rewritten:

- Uses the proper Tiltify APIs instead of the internal ones
- [Coin Me, Daddy](https://coinme.dad) was updated to work with the single coin and the host coin set
- Added a [leaderboard](https://donationdaddy.rknight.me/leaderboard)
- Hat is the new [backpack](https://backpackhelp.rknight.me)
- Going over 100% of a goal no longer messes up the rounded edge of the progress bar
- ~~Donation Treats is gone for now until I can work out a nice way of fetching them with the new API~~ [Donation Treats](https://donationtreats.rknight.me) is back, I worked it out ðŸŽ‰
- [Septembed](https://septembed.rknight.me) endpoints have been updated but existing installs will still work

I'm sure we'll have some other things going on as well which I'll be sure to post about.

Donate at [stjude.omg.lol](https://stjude.omg.lol), for the kids.
