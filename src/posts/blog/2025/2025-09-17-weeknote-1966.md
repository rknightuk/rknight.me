We've raised over ten thousand dollars for St Jude as of right now, with a couple of weeks left of September to go. You can still get stickers and I've been having a lot of fun doing [animal](https://social.lol/@wade/115170176476685244) [drawings](https://social.lol/@sleepless/115209151201563607) - I will open at least a few more slots before the end of the campaign. You can [donate at stjude.omg.lol](https://stjude.omg.lol).

[This is a lovely knob](https://ilumkb.com/products/anticater-vk-01-desktop-volume-control-knob?_pos=2&_sid=433abfa84&_ss=r&variant=42040700076114) and I want one.

[Ollee Watch](https://www.olleewatch.com/) turns your classic Casio watch into a smartwatch. This is fascinating and I could see this being a replacement for my Apple Watch.

I must have a teeny tiny [Kodak Charmera](https://petapixel.com/2025/09/09/the-kodak-charmera-is-a-tiny-digital-keychain-camera-sold-in-blind-boxes/). Just need to find somewhere to buy one.

Speaking of weird cameras, Camp Snap have [a new pro version](https://www.campsnapphoto.com/products/cs-pro-camera) coming which looks very cool.

[Life is Strange is getting a TV adaptation](https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-tv-series-announced-by-amazon-with-end-of-the-fing-world-writer-as-showrunner). I swear to god if Amazon mess this up I'm gunna flip a table.

[Letter Club](https://nazhamid.com/journal/letter-club/) is an interesting concept - a newsletter that everyone on the newsletter contributes to.

While looking for _redacted_ I came across [this site that has dimensions](https://www.dimensions.com/element/ditto) for various things including Pokemon like Ditto as well as how they compare to other objects (or in this case, a Jigglypuff).

[roughViz](https://github.com/jwilber/roughViz) is a library for creating hand-drawn styled charts in the browser. I reckon I can find a use for this soon.

This [friendly introduction to SVG](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/) is a masterclass in writing technical posts.

[HomeBox](https://homebox.software/en/) is some nice looking home inventory management software. Do I need this? Probably not but nothing says fun like home inventory.

This isn't news to anyone even vaguely familiar with map distortions but [the African Union is pushing](https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-08-20/maps-are-not-innocent-drawings-africa-demands-its-true-size-be-shown.html) to start using more accurate maps. I'm all for it.

[sveltia-cms](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) is a Netlify/Decap CMS successor and has been written from scratch. Need to try this out soon.

Finally [this toot](https://beige.party/@RickiTarr/115129335224173175) is way too real:

> We really need to start pushing the truth about AI.

> The easiest job for AI to replace would be Management.
> 
> Uses the most resources, while offering the least amount of actual productivity.
> 
> Reads something by some idiot on the internet, and bases their Management Style around it.

> Makes decisions without context.
