I was tagged by [Flamed](https://flamedfury.com/posts/music-questions-challenge/) and someone else in [the omg.lol Signal chat](https://social.lol/@adam/113932177125424355) (but there's too many messages to check who it was).

### What are five of your favourite albums?

I already wrote about this in a post entitled "[_The Perfect Album_](https://rknight.me/blog/the-perfect-album/)" so I shall refer you there. Although I'd definitely add [From Zero](https://musicthread.app/link/2osbHpeiWWq4ut3gbn15sgi7qMf) to the list of perfect albums.
### What are five of your favourite songs?

- Faint - Linkin Park
- Letters to You - Finch
- Cute Without the 'E' (Cut From the Team) - Taking Back Sunday
- Where I Belong - Simple Plan & State Champs
- Crashed the Wedding - Busted

### Favourite instrument(s)?

Guitar.

### What song or album are you currently listening to?

Bring Me the Horizon's [cover of Wonderwall](https://musicthread.app/link/2sOUgNU7i1H7npSqeuyviuxCn6m) is a fucking banger and I've listened to [The Bootstrap Paradox](https://musicthread.app/link/2lYKv2JR3tncnVxdgIlkJAXjIQ5) at least once a week since I discovered it.
### Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?

I deeply dislike the radio so much so that I keep it on mute in my car so I don't have to hear it even for the 5 seconds it takes for my phone to connect.

### How often do you listen to music?

Every day.

### How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?

I check out the Apple Music home page for recommendations once or twice a week mostly.

### What’s a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?

[Palm Trees and Power Lines by Sugarcult](https://musicthread.app/link/2sVR0ELn5wlS7WZmiMUcGpBh3g3).

### What’s your favourite song of all time?

This is a near-impossible question but maybe Faint by Linkin Park. 

### Has your taste in music evolved over the years?

Not since I was 16. I'm better at listening to albums now even if I don't know any of the songs to start with.
