tl;dr: I have a proper shop now with new sticker designs which you can [find here](http://rknight.me/shop/).

If you've been following along for the past 6 months, I designed four stickers that I sold in two different batches - [Don't @ Me and Sparkly Websites](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/) and [Pirate Bay × Training Data stickers](https://rknight.me/blog/pirate-bay-training-data-stickers/). It was a lot of effort but it was a fun thing to do.

The "effort" was twofold: setting up Stripe payment links every time I wanted to sell a new batch and doing addresses on the envelopes. I setup an Eleventy site to do some of the work of laying out addresses so I could print onto label sheets which was fine until my printer ran out of ink and I had to hand-write ~100 envelopes.

The latter problem was easy to solve: an [Adam](https://www.neatnik.net)-approved [thermal printer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C3B6RRDG), the beautifully named "_OFFNOVA USB Shipping Label Printer, 4x6 Thermal Printer for Shipping Packages, High-Speed Label Maker, Compatible with ShipStation, UPS, FedEx, Ebay, Amazon, Shopify, USPS_". It's a 4×6 thermal printer that has drivers for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The only learning curve was making sure to pick the 4×6 paper size from the print dialog otherwise you get cut-off labels. Like before, I setup an Eleventy site that takes a CSV and outputs each address as a full page which then print to the labels. Because it's just HTML, I could easily add the Robb Knight × omg.lol logos in the bottom left.

The first problem though, of having a proper store, was a bit more complicated. There are so many fees associated with some platforms (looking at you Etsy) that it's hard to know how much it would cost to sell a single sticker. Then I remembered my friends over at [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com) have [a sticker store](https://hemisphericviews.bigcartel.com) that runs on [Big Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com). Big Cartel has a free tier limited to five products, one photo per product, plus some other limitations, but it's perfect for me to get started. Even when I do upgrade, it's $15 a month and that's it. No skimming a percentage from sales or anything like that. 

I bought a cutting mat to take photos on, ordered the first batch of stickers, and got the store up and running last night. There are three new designs: Pen Addiction, Mildliner Bouquet, and nAIve,. plus the aforementioned Pirate Bay ones and a discount pack which gets you everything in the shop plus a bonus Jeff Sinclair sticker.

I'm going to see how this goes for the next month of so and if it works out, I'll start adding new stickers (I already have a shedload of ideas including [this one](https://social.lol/@robb/115729511833154812)). I've not had a sale yet so either no one wants to spend money this close to Christmas because this is a terrible time to launch a store or the site is broken. We will find out 🤞
