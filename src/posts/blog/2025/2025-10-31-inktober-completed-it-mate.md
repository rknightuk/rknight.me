After my adventures with [getting okay at drawing](https://rknight.me/blog/get-okay/) I decided to have a go at participating in [Inktober](https://inktober.com) - one drawing every day for 31 days based on a prompt, the full list of which you can [see here](https://inktober.com/rules).

I did the first two prompts (mustache and weave) and then on the third day I stumbled upon a dinosaur character I quite liked, who I have named Jeff. He appeared in the next few drawings so I went back and redid them to feature Jeff. I love Jeff.

I love all my inky children equally but these are some of my favourites. I find it notable these are all after the halfway point of the month.

The first is a dinosaur looking in a mirror, the second is a dinosaur using a magnfying glass to look at a firefly, the third is a puzzle with a dinosaur on, and the fourth is an empty room with a dinosaur looking in the window.](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/inktober-faves.jpg)

My John McClane one for [day 15 "ragged"](https://rknight.me/notes/202510150414/) got a lot of traction and birthed this glorious "screenshot" from Die Hard:

Did I learn anything about myself or drawing or whatever? Yeah I did:

- I actually enjoy drawing if I put some effort in
- I need to learn more about perspective
- I prefer Uni Pin over Micron fineliners
- Drawing existing characters is _hard_. If anything is even slightly off, it looks weird

Now I've finished I feel a bit lost because I have no prompts but I have had an idea I want to try - [Lost Americana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Americana) has a logo for each track so I think I'm going to try and do the same thing for a different album, probably [Meteora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteora_(album)).

This also isn't the last of Jeff, he's featured in the November cover page of my journal:

And I'm working on a sticker based on the [Sinclair Oil Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Oil_Corporation) logo:

![A white sticker with a green border. It says Jeff in bold italic letters at the top and has a green dinosaur at the bottom](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/jeff-sinclair-sticker.png)

You can see all my [inktober entries here](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/inktober2025/). I guess I'm somewhat of an artist myself now.
