This is a set of 0.5mm Pilot Juice pens in neon pink, green, and orange. "Planet Labyrinth" is the set name - theres also a set available called "[Space Smash](https://stationerypal.com/products/pilot-juice-space-smash-limited-edition-gel-pen-neon-color-set-of-3)". The pink is _gorgeous_ and the orange is wonderfully vibrant. The green is pretty disappointing though and hard to see at some angles (like my photo above). Here's a close up so you can see what it does look like. I think a 0.7mm tip might have been better for the green.
