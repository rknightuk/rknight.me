Of all the things parents can annoy you with the clichÃ©s are the worst. "You won't know until you try". Okay mum, whatever you say. I think you know where this is going.

I've always thought I wasn't any good at drawing but what had actually happened is I never tried. Like really, sat down with a pencil and paper and tried to draw something. Maybe with a reference image. It turns out, if you actually try a little bit you might be okay at a thing.

Near the start of the St Jude campaign I noticed I had some spare stamps so I figured why not use them on something interesting like...do a drawing and I'll send it to someone. Initially I intended them to be my usual "I haven't tried that hard" ones but then people actually donated for one and I panicked. _I can't send something crap to someone who has donated, it had to be at least a little bit good_. So I actually sat down and tried. Those came out pretty well so I offered a few more. And some more. By the end of the campaign I had sent out 26 unique animal drawings and one London bus (Hi Joe ðŸ‘‹). Turns out, I was _okay_ at drawing.

These requests led me to ask some curious questions like do snails have nostrils? Whats the different between a tortoise and a turtle? What the fuck is an opossum? What is an ionic column? If a hotdog horse had a hot dog bun body, would the legs also be made of bun?[^1]

Doing these added somewhere in the region of $1000 to the [total we raised](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2025-recap/) this year and has introduced me to a new hobby I'm  enjoying and doesn't cost lots of money. I've been [doing Inktober](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/inktober2025/) and plan to continue through the rest of the month. I also seemed to have stumbled upon a character who is yet to be named, but he is a dinosaur with little stubby hands and feet. Here he is on his way to comic con, lil' cutie.
