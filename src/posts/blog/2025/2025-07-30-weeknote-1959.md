I'm at the end of my first journal and starting a new one on Friday. I've learnt some lessons about what does and doesn't work for me, spent some time setting up some collections for ideas to keep track of those and of course I [setup the mildliner sample pages again](https://rknight.me/notes/202507292100/). I'm also excited to use my yellow EF TWSBI Eco which doesn't write nicely in my current journal. 

I picked up a slide for Baby Knight which just _barely_ fit in my car and made the drive back pretty precarious but she bloody loves it so it's all worth it.

I had a lot of fun with [KnightPrint](https://rknight.me/blog/knightprints-first-run/). I think I'll turn it on for a bit longer tomorrow.

The [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com) sticker for St Jude fundraising this year is designed and ready to go. I started with one idea, scrapped that, and a new one came together really quickly. Stayed tuned for updates very soon[^1].

Testing is continuing on EchoFeed rules and profiles. I want to make sure I get this right so it's taking longer than I originally hoped.

I entered the [TRMNL hackathon](https://usetrmnl.com/blog/hackathon-book-readers) with a fun movie-adjacent plugin. Winners will be announced Friday and I'll put a post up about it after that.

[Lettervoxed](https://lettervoxd.com/) "_is a tool that extracts esoteric words from about 25,000 movies from the past century_" and feels like something I wish I'd thought of. Incredible work that led me to remembering this classic line from [Ali G Indahouse (2002)](https://lettervoxd.com/movie.html?imdb_id=tt0284837), one of only three movies in the corpus to use the word "knobbing":

> We is knobbing two birds with one connie.

I've been enjoying [the new Tony Hawk](https://rknight.me/blog/unorganised-thoughts-about-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4/) and I happened upon this community list of [all the different fonts](https://github.com/DCxDemo/ThpsFonts) used in the games.

[Mel built and released](https://melkat.dev/melanie/blue-rose) an 11ty starter kit specifically for photos, very cool.

[rssrssrss](https://www.rssrssrssrss.com) can combine multiple RSS feeds into one.

This [Steve Caballero house tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNH7USgcxZY) is wonderful (via [Dan](https://simplebits.com)).

Pocket has been saved and is now [Folio](https://savewithfolio.com). [John has the details on MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/folio-a-promising-read-later-app-with-a-strong-foundation/).

Want to render every road in a city? [Of course you do](https://anvaka.github.io/city-roads/). You can customise the colours and export as a PNG or SVG too.

[Vert](https://vert.sh) is a local file conversation webapp that supports a boatload of formats.

[Pointer Pointer](https://pointerpointer.com) is very silly and I love it.

You owe it to yourself to watch this video of [Vienetta being made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZrv81wY8HQ).

[David came to the same conclusion](https://davidcs.net/how-i-use-my-bullet-journal/) as [I did](https://rknight.me/blog/five-months-of-journalling/) about BuJo:

> I just want a nice way to stay organized, not a cult!

[Jordan Elver came to the same conclusion as I did about Blackpool](https://weeknotes.elver.me/weeknotes-213/) and I didn't even get to see a big Tesco.

>  If you have nothing good to say don’t say anything at all, however, highlights were the very fancy car park in the centre, and the massive Tesco Extra - really, it has to be seen to be believed.

Finally, no notes on [this local Facebook group post](https://crispsandwi.ch/@sarahdal/114932545231536842):
