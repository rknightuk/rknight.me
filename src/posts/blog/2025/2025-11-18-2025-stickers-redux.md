Now the dust has settled on the [piracy stickers](https://rknight.me/blog/pirate-bay-training-data-stickers/), I checked how many I had left and it was a few more than I thought so I'm putting them back up for sale until they run out. Here's what I have available:

- Four pack of the Don't Know Don't Care Don't @ Me stickers. There's only two of these available. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/dRmdR90Ew2QKdfC4Uc2kw04)
- Training Data double pack. 2 × Pirate Bay, 2 × Piracy Ad. I have 20 or so packs of these. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/14AaEXaf6ezs7Vi86o2kw02)
- Pirate Bay four pack. There's 10 or so of these available. [Buy](https://buy.stripe.com/5kQeVdcnebng8ZmgCU2kw03)

I will do another run of the [Sparkly Websites stickers](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/) very soon — I don't have any of those left right now. As always, the [shop page](/shop) has all the links as well, at least until I decide on a better system for selling stickers.
