[The Palmer utility knife](https://thejamesbrand.eu/products/the-palmer?variant=51640084726126) was mentioned on the latest episode of [The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/651) and it sent me down a rabbit hole, albeit a small one. Studio Neat have the [Keen](https://www.studioneat.com/products/keen?variant=48579435266325) which is shipping this summer and costs £78 and then there's the [SlideWinder](https://www.outdooredge.com/products/slidewinder?variant=8737499840548) at £15. Told you it was a small hole.

I am mostly tempted by the Palmer in atomic purple - the design of it appeals to me more than the others. I nearly bought it until I considered it for a moment; I just wouldn't use this kind of knife that often.

It is fun to see a bunch of different companies tackling this very specific problem though.
