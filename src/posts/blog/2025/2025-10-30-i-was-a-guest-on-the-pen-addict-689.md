Myke was off this week so Brad asked me to fill in on [episode 689](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/689) of The Pen Addict.

We caught up on what I've been up to since [the last time I was on](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/657) in March, how pens led me indirectly into [drawing for St Jude](https://rknight.me/blog/get-okay/) and then [Inktober](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/inktober2025/). To wrap up toptober we did our top five stationery items of this year which included a discussion of our handwriting styles.

Since recording I have ordered [Diamine Claret](https://mountainofink.com/blog/ink-review-diamine-claret), Brad is sending me a sample of [Pilot Iroshizuku Tsutsuji](https://mountainofink.com/blog/pilot-iroshizuku-tsutsuji) and Ben is sending me a sample of [Robert Oster Hot Pink](https://mountainofink.com/blog/robert-oster-hot-pink) to try out in my Funky Town.
