excerpt: "I tried to resurrect my Pebble Steel"

With the news that [Pebble is coming back](https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back) I dug out my Pebble Steel to see if it still worked.

After fiddling around with the _terrible_ charging cable, getting stuck in a loop for a while, it finally booted and I was able to set the watch face to the [Relay](https://relay.fm) one I made a decade ago.

Sadly when I disconnect the charger, it turns off. I guess it needs a new battery but I don't have the energy or the time to do that so back into storage it goes.
