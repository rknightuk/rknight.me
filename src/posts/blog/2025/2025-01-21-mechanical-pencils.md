excerpt: "Some recommendations for mechanical pencils I was given"
---

I asked for recommendations for mechanical pencils in the Relay and omg.lol Discords and here’s what was recommended:

- [Uniball Kuru Toga](https://www.unibrands.co/collections/kuru-toga) - this one has a fancy sharpening mechanism
- [Tombow mono graph](https://www.tombow.com/en/products/mono_graph/) - I picked one of these up on Amazon for £3 to give it a go
- The [Pentel sharp](https://www.pentel.co.uk/product/pentel-e-sharp-mechanical-pencil-0-5mm-twin-pack-with-tube-of-0-5mm-hb-refill-leads-yaz125-rcy-2m/) looks very nice
- Kathy mentioned “forever pencils” and my mind was blown so I ordered exactly what she told me to - this [Sun Star retractable one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BKRV5PJF)
