I asked for recommendations for mechanical pencils in the Relay and omg.lol Discords and here’s what was recommended:

- [Uniball Kuru Toga](https://www.unibrands.co/collections/kuru-toga) - this one has a fancy sharpening mechanism
- [Tombow mono graph](https://www.tombow.com/en/products/mono_graph/) - I picked one of these up on Amazon for £3 to give it a go
- The [Pentel sharp](https://www.pentel.co.uk/product/pentel-e-sharp-mechanical-pencil-0-5mm-twin-pack-with-tube-of-0-5mm-hb-refill-leads-yaz125-rcy-2m/) looks very nice
- Kathy mentioned “forever pencils” and my mind was blown so I ordered exactly what she told me to - this [Sun Star retractable one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BKRV5PJF)

Some more recommendations came in after I [tooted this post](https://social.lol/@robb/113866549222654449):

- [Jason](https://social.lol/@jasonm/113867365746357380) and [B](https://social.lol/@binarydigit/113866703468590160) like the Pentel Graphgear; the [500](https://www.pentel.co.uk/product/pentel-graphgear-500-automatic-pencil-pg500/) and [1000](https://www.pentel.co.uk/product/pentel-graphgear-1000-automatic-pencil-pg1000/) respectively.
- Myke pointed me to [this episode of The Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/635)
- Tyler has a [great post](https://www.tylersticka.com/journal/a-pencil-named-excalibur/) about Excalibur, a [Pentel Twist Erase](https://www.pentel.co.uk/product/pentel-twist-erase-automatic-pencil-qe51/)
- Finally, [Tim likes the Rotring rapid pro](https://social.lol/@ezwal/113868481408421705)
