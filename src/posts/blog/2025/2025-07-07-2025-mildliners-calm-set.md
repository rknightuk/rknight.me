I said in [this post](https://rknight.me/blog/how-many-mildliner-colours-are-there-now/) that I ordered the new 2025 Mildliners and they arrived this morning. These are some excellent colours and I'm amazed they've been able to find five new colours that are distinct from the existing 36 (now 41). Iris is particularly nice.

They were already on [the Mildliner reference site](https://mildliners.rknight.me) and I've added them to my test page in the back of my journal:

These still haven't appeared on any of the sites I usually buy from but I assume they'll trickle into stock in the next few months.
