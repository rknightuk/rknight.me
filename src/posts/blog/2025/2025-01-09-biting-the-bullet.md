I’ve been todo hoarding. I have Reminders, Obsidian, and Godspeed all with different types of todos in them. Plus GitHub issues, Mastodon mentions, and Raindrop. I’m not getting to any of them. I’m missing things I should be doing. I’m forgetting important things. Also at least once a week I want to throw my computer into the sea because something that should work just doesn’t. I need to spend less wasted time on computers. 

I’ve tried using notebooks before to keep track of things but without a system to organise them they just become random scribblings the likes of which wouldn’t be out of place in the zodiac killer’s apartment. 

So I’m gunna try [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/). You don’t need to send help (except maybe for my YouTube recommendations). But if I become the kind of person who doesn’t shut the fuck up about it I’m appointing [Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/) to metaphorically smack me in my stupid note-taking face.
