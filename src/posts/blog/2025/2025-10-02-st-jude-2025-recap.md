It's the 2nd of October, AKA [Bonus September](https://isitseptember.fyi/) which means Relay's St Jude campaign is more-or-less over, having blown past the $700k target. Adam and I fell short of our target but still [raised over $15k](https://tiltify.com/@rknightuk/stjude2025), putting us just shy of $49k raised over the past three years.

As we tend to do, we added additional stickers during the campaign. Everyone who donated for stickers is getting five stickers instead of the original two which are being ordered and posted very soon.

On a whim, I added an incentive to get an animal drawing from me. These turned out to be quite popular so I ended up doing 27 of them in total and the final ones went into the post yesterday. I'll have a separate post up about that soon but here's one I did for [Kevin](https://akevcalled.quest/):

Like I did [last year](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2024-recap/), I bought a roast from [JD](https://jdburch.com/) who destroyed my website with his youthful venom:

> Alright, Robb, it’s your turn. rknight.me, what a digital masterpiece. I mean, in the same way a Facebook marketplace listing with a few blurry photos is a masterpiece. Your website looks like the cool indie blog your friend built in the mid-2010s… except slower. That 4.56s LCP time means I could’ve walked my pet dinosaur before I saw an image appear. Listen, I’m not a web dev, but good thing you didn’t ask that before telling me to roast your website. I went to the Eleventy leaderboards and man do you have a lot of ⚠️ and 🚫 icons everywhere! Do I understand what most of the abbreviations mean? Heck no, but it’s a good thing Eleventy uses icons. Well, not for you, I suppose…
>
> Ok, but the typography. It feels like it was chosen by closing your eyes and spinning the Google Fonts wheel. And no capitalization on the proper nouns? Is that what they teach in schools across the pond, right after your multiple math classes? The color scheme is straight out of a disco, which is certainly a vibe. 
>
> Robb, you certainly love your links. Your website is a choose your own adventure book, where every choice leads to another hallway of sub-links, dropdowns, ‘more here’, and ‘check this out’ pages. You can't just visit rknight.me, you get lost in it, just like in Ikea. At least at Ikea they give you meatballs when you’re trapped, though. Click one link, and you’re suddenly three levels deep in a subsection that exists solely to link to more subsections. It’s the Russian nesting dolls of websites.
> 
> So, yeah, your website is a maze of slow-loading pages and questionable design. But hey, at least it’s memorable! Not because it’s good, but because it’s the only website where I can both roast it and see my name immortalized in /uses. Without that part? Just another personal blog site on the internet. 

I donated to have my name, and those of my friends `Robbb` and `Robbbb`, on [Brad](https://tiltify.com/@penaddict/relay-for-st-jude-2025-fundraiser)'s board:

I'm a sucker for incentives so I donated for stickers and a coin holder from [MVO](https://tiltify.com/@mvo/mvo-plays-mass-effect-for-st-jude-2025), a postcard from [Lisa](https://tiltify.com/@oliveoctopusink/relay-stjude-2025) which arrived this morning, the Brad pack from [Kaleidocraft](https://tiltify.com/@myers18purdue/kaleidocraft-x-relay-for-st-jude-2025-fundraiser), stickers from [Ste](https://tiltify.com/@stegrainer/ste-for-st-jude), and a pin from [the Lovely Devs](https://tiltify.com/@thelovelydevelopers/the-lovely-developers-for-st-jude-2025).

The newly updated [Donation Daddy](https://donationdaddy.rknight.me/) site worked perfectly throughout the month and I already have some fun ideas for next year.

Thank you to everyone who donated or shared the campaign. It makes a difference.
