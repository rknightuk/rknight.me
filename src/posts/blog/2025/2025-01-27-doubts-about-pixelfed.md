I have a Pixelfed account. I don't post much, but it's there. I like having a dedicated place to post photos. I like seeing other people's photos.  Let me start by saying that Dan, the maintainer of Pixelfed, has always been very helpful when I've asked him about various ActivityPub-related things. He knows his shit when it comes to the AP spec. This post is a collection of concerns I've had over the past few months about Pixelfed and the way it's longevity.

Dan, to [quote Mel](https://melkat.blog/p/pixelfed-disappointment/), "_posting like a Founder_ (derogatory)", was not a fun thing to witness. 

The [Pixelfed Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixelfed/pixelfed-foundation-2024-real-ethical-social-networks) says they want to be "_the first Fediverse app with a billion people_". Dream big by all means but this is chaotic. We've seen what happens with billion-people social networks - federation isn't going to solve this.

In Mel's post she noticed that the project account posted about a new data export feature available that day. It wasn't, and still isn't, available. The export that _is_ available doesn't actually include your images, it's just JSON with the URLs to the files. Not an ideal export for anyone without technical knowledge. 

As it turns out Pixelfed.social runs the latest commit from the repo, which means the format is different to the release version so the [code Mel put together](https://gist.melkat.dev/melanie/pixelfed-to-md) only works for _other_ Pixelfed servers. Handily, [Posty](https://posty.1sland.social/pixelfed) supports both formats. It's worth noting the version on Pixelfed.social _isn't_ the full HTML version that was posted about, just a new format.

Finally [this overview](https://dansup-open-letter.github.io/appendix/) of Dan's "_hostility towards FOSS maintainers and the ecosystem at large_" is a really uncomfortable read and doesn't bode well for the future of the project.

All of this combined makes me not want to use Pixelfed so I'm going to be converting my export to note posts for here instead and deleting my Pixelfed account.
