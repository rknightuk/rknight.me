Hot innit. Too fucking hot.

Wednesday night we went up [Portsdown Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsdown_Hill) with the kids for dinner because we couldn't be bothered to cook so we got burgers from [Mick's](https://www.facebook.com/p/Micks-Monster-Burgers-100057133133661/?locale=en_GB). It also gave Baby Knight the First somewhere to run around like a lunatic to burn off some energy. It didn't work but she did have fun.

My wife wanted an instant printer to print some photos of the kids for her journal and it was Prime Day so we had a look around. I'd decided, as CTO of our house, that the [Kodak P300R](https://kodakphotoprinter.com/products/best-photo-printer-kodak-mini-3-retro) was perfect for what we wanted but then I noticed for an entire one pound extra, we could have the [C300R](https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/instant-print/mini-shot-3-square-retro/) which is the same thing, but with a camera built-in as well. It's a fun item and it'll make a nice friend for our [Instax Mini](https://instax.co.uk/cameras/).

I'm not a designer so I'm not getting frothy knickers to give my hot takes on Liquid Glass, with the exception of [this toot](https://social.lol/@robb/114658653379041130), but this [Glass3D CSS generator](https://glass3d.dev) is pretty natty. I used something similar with an initial version of [Portal Kombat](https://portkom.rknight.me) and looks good when used correctly.

[The Death Generator](https://deathgenerator.com/#gallery) is a collection of game screens with dialog or text that you can edit to make your own. The [Pok√©mon one](https://deathgenerator.com/#pokemon) would have saved me so much time when I did [these](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-one/) [posts](https://rknight.me/blog/trying-raycast-part-two/).

[Bears will be Boys](https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/) looks at how animals are gendered in books as well as by people in general. 

[Macrowave](https://lucas.love/projects/macrowave) is a fascinating project. "_...a native macOS and iOS app that makes it easy to share system audio with friends to listen to music together_". And it looks incredible as well.

I've been playing around with using the 8BitDo Micro controller as an automation tool, like [John talked about here](https://www.macstories.net/stories/my-latest-mac-automation-tool-is-a-tiny-game-controller/) on MacStories. I won't go into it too much, I'm saving that for [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com).
