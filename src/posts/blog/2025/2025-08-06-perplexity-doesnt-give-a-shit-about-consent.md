I linked to [this post from CloudFlare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/) yesterday where they showed, based on the data they have, that Perplexity is using all sorts of shitty tactics to get around robots.txt[^1] and other blocks based on user agent.

Perplexity then put up [their own blog post](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/agents-or-bots-making-sense-of-ai-on-the-open-web) where they used the best part of 1000 words to explain they either don't understand consent, or don't care.

I was going to quote various parts of the article explain why that part is bullshit but it's not worth the time. At the core of this issue is consent. Even if you agree that AI agents shouldn't be treated like other AI crawlers or if you think Perplexity is awesome, it's my website and I get to decide who accesses it. _Consent_.

This [Hacker News commenter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44793045) shares a lot of the same views as me on the matter:

> I don't want my content to be accessible to you through Perplexity.
>
> I want my work to be freely available to any person who wants it. Feel free to transform my material as you see fit. Hell, do it with LLMs! I don't care.
>
> The LLM isn't the problem, it's what companies like Perplexity are doing with the LLM. Do _not_ create commercial products that regurgitate my work as if it was your own. It's _de facto_ theft, if not _de jure_ theft.
>
> Knowing that it is not _de jure_ theft, and so I have no legal recourse, I will continue to tune my servers to block and/or deceive Perplexity and similar tools.

[Once](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/) [again](https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-robotstxt-and-other-questions/), fuck Perplexity.
