It's June already somehow. Wild. The passage of time comes for us all.

We had to say goodbye to our cat Morpheus at the weekend. He had fluid in his lungs and his heart was failing. We lost his brother two years ago as well so this is the first time in 14 years we've been a pet free house and I hate it. RIP buddy.

My wife has been side-eyeing my notebooks and pens for the past couple of months and she finally caved and ordered a notebook. Then she proceeded to order all manner of washi tapes, stickers, and stencils. This is gunna be fun[^1].

[Sticker sales](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/) have been better than I imagined they would be but I'm also bad at maths. I miscalculated how much money I made, I bought twice as many envelopes as I needed, and I ordered too many stickers compared to how many orders I had. Please [buy some](/shop/dont-at-me) so I'm not drowning in spares.

I ordered a [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) at the start of the week and it's arriving today. I've been [tinkering with some plugins](https://social.lol/@robb/114633354432109282) and put this one together ready for Relay for St Jude in September. I'll write up a longer post about it when I've got my hands on it.

I designed a sticker for [Brad](https://penaddict.com) and I can't wait to see the final result.

I've completely changed my Obsidian usage after reading [this post](https://stephango.com/vault) from Steph Ango. No more folders, everything in the root. Search does the work now.

### Links

I have three posts about [Vento](https://vento.js.org), a new templating language. I'm not in a rush to switch but I'm curious to see how it moves forward.

- [From Nunjucks to Vento in Eleventy: a migration guide (kinda)](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/from-nunjucks-to-vento-in-eleventy-migration-guide/)

[James](https://jamesg.blog) made [Subscribe Openly](https://subscribeopenly.net/) as a response to [_A request for developers of feed reader apps and services_](https://multiline.co/mment/2025/05/request-for-feed-reader-app-developers/). Anything that makes RSS easier to use is good in my book.

Three new fonts to gawp at:

- [Bowery Lane by Hoodzpah](https://hoodzpahdesign.com/product/bowery-lane-font/). The swash alternates on this are incredible.
- [Kelmscott Mono: A black letter for the text editor](https://github.com/seeddisperser/kelmscott-mono). I love this.
- [Azimut](https://azimut.strasbourg.eu/english.html)

[Eleventy LibDoc](https://eleventy-libdoc.netlify.app/) is "an Eleventy starter project to craft slick and responsive documentation" and it's _really_ nice.

Finally a couple of somewhat doomy posts about the internet falling apart. [_The Internet of Consent_](https://www.anildash.com//2025/05/27/2025-05-27-internet-of-consent/) by Anil Dash and [_The promise that wasn’t kept_](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/the-promise-that-wasnt-kept/) by Salma Alam-Naylor:

Yes. One thousand times this.
