Things are in motion to get a proper sticker shop online early in the new year - I have a new sticker I'm excited to make plus I'm going to keep stock of some that people always ask for.

And more sticker news, the St Jude campaign stickers are on their way to everyone _not_ in the UK. If you're in the UK, I have them in hand and will get them posted as soon as I can.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) has nuked the global leaderboard and dropped down the 12 days instead of 24. Maybe I'll give it a go again next year.

The [Aston Martin Cygnet](https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202510157175280?refresh=true https://www.astonmartin.com/en-gb/models/past-models/cygnet-archive) is adorable and I love it. Also it's £40k second hand so perhaps not.

This [internet scrapbook idea](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/social-media-scrapbook/) from Alex is great.

[Clues by Sam](https://cluesbysam.com/tutorial/) is a new daily game that I enjoyed once but won't play because I know I'll stress myself out needing to do it every day.

[This post](https://chameth.com/making-a-font-of-my-handwriting/) reminded me I want to make my own handwriting font. I should get on that.

[Public Transport Card Designs](https://transitcards.xyz) is exactly what the internet was made for. 

This post about [Culdesac](https://devonzuegel.com/field-notes-culdesac), "Arizona's car-free neighborhood", is fascinating - one shop for every 14.5 residents. Don't miss [their website](https://culdesac.com/tempe/) with more photos, floorplans, and info on it.

[Victorian Christmas cards](https://thewallflowerdigest.co.uk/books/top-ten-tuesday/my-10-favourite-victorian-christmas-cards/) are something else entirely. Tag yourself, I'm mutant parsnip man.

[Intertapes](https://intertapes.net) is a collection of found cassettes and their contents. There's some gorgeous SVGs on the [formats page](https://intertapes.net/formats/). RSS feed please.

This fork of [Streetpass](https://streetpass.social) but [for RSS](https://github.com/robalexdev/blog-quest) is handy. Chrome and Firefox only right now.
