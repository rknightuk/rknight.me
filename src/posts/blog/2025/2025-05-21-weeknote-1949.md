I never liked the [link dump](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/linkdump/) name for what was essentially [weeknotes](https://gilest.org/doingweeknotes/index.html) - the name was bad and I had other things I wanted to include[^1]. I'm never going to manage to do this every week though so instead I'm stealing [Chris'](https://chrishannah.me/weeknote/1703/) numbering solution. That way, I can do one whenever I feel like it.

I blogged about [post filtering on EchoFeed](https://rknight.me/blog/hack-club-post-filtering-on-echofeed/) which I'm currently finalising for release. I also have a couple of other fun social features I'm working on.

I'm thinking about selling [a sticker](https://social.lol/@robb/114502593595519553) but I need to work out the shipping logistics first.

I hooked up my PS2 last week and it turns out Tony Hawk 3 and 4 won't run at all so I've ripped them to run them with the [PCSX2](https://pcsx2.net/) emulator. I assume some of my other games won't run either so I'll rip those as well. So far though, everything I've tried has run perfectly with PCSX2. Maybe I should stream some THPS at some point.

### Links

Some fonts I've saved over the past couple of weeks while working on a few things:

- [Soft Text](https://www.future-fonts.com/soft-type/soft-text)
- [Homemade Sausage](https://www.dafont.com/homemade-sausage.font)
- [Spicy Pumpkin](https://www.dafont.com/spicy-pumpkin.font)
- [Highbright](https://www.creativefabrica.com/product/highbright-font/)
- [Arnold by Rüdiger](https://www.future-fonts.com/rudiger/arnold)

And [Beasts of England](https://beastsofengland.co) has a lot of lovely fonts.

[The Steak Bake spider](https://alasdairrae.github.io/steakbakespider/) is an important edition to the internet and must be protected. I'd love to see the code for this.

Remy Sharp put together a [CSS flag generator](https://flag.isthe.link).

The [The 12-bit rainbow palette](https://iamkate.com/data/12-bit-rainbow/) will be going in [my toolkit](https://rknight.me/intersect/web/toolkit/).

[itter.sh](https://www.itter.sh/) is "Social Media via SSH". I'm on there as @rknightuk but I doubt I'll use it much. A fun concept.

[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) is the game engine used by Balatro and there's a great [book called How to LÖVE](https://sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents) for learning how it works.

[Hosting checker](https://hosting-checker.net) is handy and seems pretty comprehensive.

I'm still obsessed with these [fictional hotel notepads](https://www.herblester.com/collections/stationery). 

The [pink Life noble notebooks](https://hachimonjiya.com/en-us/collections/original-notes/products/noble-note-ayame) that Brad always teases me with are now available to ship outside of Japan. RIP my wallet.

### Miscellanea

This is a tweet, which I would usually never screenshot, much less post on my website, but it's too good not to share.

> oh poor baby 🥺🥺 do you need the robot to make you pictures? 🥺🥺 yeah?🥺🥺 do you need the bo-bot to write you essay too? yeah??? you can't do it?? 🥺🥺you're a moron??🥺🥺 do do you need chat gpt to fuck your wife ?? 🥺🥺🥺

The person [who tweeted this](https://x.com/peterokii) had to delete it after the AI bros started harrassing them (I can't find the tweet now 🤷‍♂️).

This story about [seagulls smashing the roof of a library in Oxford](https://thetab.com/2025/04/15/university-of-oxford-building-evacuated-after-seagulls-smash-glass-roof-with-stones) led [Lewis](https://lewisdale.dev) to make this very good, but under appreciated, joke in the omg.lol discord:

> “What did you do when the Flock of Seagulls attacked?” 
>
> “I ran”

Finally an astute observation from [macmanx](https://macmanx.com):

> One of the nice things about being on this Discord is being informed about new and exciting fascists

[^1]: I've updated the link dump posts to have the [weeknote tag](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/weeknote/) for the sake of completeness
