A few days ago I was looking for some new sticky tabs to use in my journal to mark the start of months and some important pages but I wanted something more interesting that the usual crap you can get at any stationery shop. 

I'd almost given up, ready to order some boring Post-It branded ones, when I happened upon some from a company called [If](https://www.ifplc.com/products/), who have a range named _Bookaroo_. Their website says they are a direct-to-retailer company but they do sell direct on Amazon. They have a bunch of stuff, including this [list notebook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CN7D9V7P/) which I'm definitely getting, but I started by ordering [these sticky tabs](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BPDTNYQW).

There are 40 in a pack, ten of each colour. This particular pack is called "Pastels, White" even though there is no white and they have three other colour packs available. They have a cartoony folder page edge design and they are very sturdy, much thicker than I'd expected.

Having said that I prefer these to the much more flimsy tabs I've been using. I don't feel like I'm going to accidentally rip these out when flipping to a page marked by one. They're Â£4 for a pack which, given it's going to take me months to get through 40 of them[^1], seems like a pretty decent price.
