Final day of the year, final weeknote of 2025. 

The [sticker shop is live](http://rknight.me/shop/) as of a couple of weeks ago with a handful of stickers I think you'll like.

I'm into a new journal for tomorrow and this time I'm using a [Leuchtturm1917 Bullet Journal](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/bullet-journal-edition-2.html) I got for a steep discount. The paper isn't as thick as the [STM paper](https://scribblesthatmatter.com) I used last year but it's certainly nice to write on. I definitely have some more thoughts about the Bullet Journal brand but that's for another time.

I am getting so many ads on YouTube for fucking AI generation, AI business leader training, and it's all shit. Stop it. Just stop.

[KFC have a merch shop](https://kfcshop.co.uk) and I want [this hat](https://kfcshop.co.uk/products/kfc-020). I don't need it but also, KFC hat.

The song "Louie Louie" has been covered upwards of 1600 times. "Three chords and the most mundane beat possible. Any idiot could learn it, and they all did." is a very funny description of the song. I just went to get a link for the song, having read the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Louie) not actually knowing what the was, only to realise I do know it. [I'm assuming everyone does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RZJ4ESU52U).

[Malcolm in the Middle is back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZjKLQ5ZUOs&feature=youtu.be) and I am here for it.

Superman by Goldfinger went gold earlier this year and they [performed it with Tony Hawk on vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5YlHs4f2IU) at the Warped tour. As I always do when I mention this song, check out [Mike Herrera's acoustic version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nC5mDNGkUc) and his [version of No Cigar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUkMjsVnb2g) while we're at it.

Spigen made [an entirely unnecessary Classic Mac case](https://www.spigen.com/products/apple-mac-mini-stand-classic-c1) for the Mac Mini and I want it.

Mel put together [`now-updater`](https://source.tube/melanie/now-updater) which automatically updates your now page. Imagine [this Rube Goldberg machine](https://rknight.me/blog/automating-my-now-page/) I built but it's easy to use and better in every way. It's that.

[Game Font Library](https://www.gamefontlibrary.com/games) is a new site listing fonts from games, 259 of them as of this writing.

It's not for me right now, but [Year Compass](https://yearcompass.com/#download) is an interesting idea. (via [Juhis](https://hamatti.org))

I linked to [this National Park-style font pack](https://rachelkickdesign.com/products/national-forest-font-duo-1) in [weeknote 1973](https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1973/). Turns out there's [another similar one available](https://nationalparktypeface.com/Downloads-Donations) with seven weights.

Adam made this [printable one-page calendar](https://neatnik.net/calendar/) a while back and I printed one to stick in my journal. If you want to see some other versions or find out why Adam is _the worst_, it was [on Hacker News this week](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46408613). [Ellane also has some markdown calendars](https://ellanew.com/2025/12/30/markdown-calendars-2026) if that's your thing.

I love this [outtakes post](https://anhvn.com/posts/2025/outtakes-etc/#incomplete-projects-that-i-posted-about-that-are-more-or-less-abandoned-in-their-current-state) from anh.

Finally these [Pigeon Post](https://pigeonposted.com/shop/) combination letter/envelopes are really cool and I'm buying some for sure. Maybe I'll send some of [my stickers](http://rknight.me/shop/) to random buyers.
