I started bullet journalling [a month ago](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) and it's my understanding that part of getting into analogue tools is buying too many pens and shit. Well I have bought a lot of pens and shit since I started.

> I feel like "a lot of pens" is underselling it

[Thanks for that, Lewis](https://social.lol/@lewis/113990259881243798).

I needed a case for the handful of pens, pencils, and a ruler I want to use in my journal so I went on a hunt for something slim and came across the [Lihit Lab Compact Pen Case](https://www.eng.lihit-lab.com/a-7687-compact-pen-case/).

It has a double zip, two pockets for pens, plus smaller slots for other things. The website says it's water and stain repellent although I haven't tested that claim. I imagine it could hold maybe ten pens but it might be a bit of a tight squeeze - with two fountain pens on the left hand side and a full right side made it a bit too bulky for my liking.

It comes in four relatively boring colors so I went with red. It costs ~£10 which is very reasonable, the build quality seems solid, and it does exactly what I wanted. I'm also considering buying a second one for some of my smaller DIY stuff.
