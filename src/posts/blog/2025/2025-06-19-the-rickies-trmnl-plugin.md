I was listening to [the results of the Rickies](https://www.relay.fm/connected/556) a couple of days ago and realised it was a perfect candidate for a plugin for my [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/).

Both [Rickipedia](https://rickies.net/) and [The Rickies](https://rickies.co) have API endpoints to check these things â€” I ended up using Rickipedia as it had more info available to do what I needed.

The plugin handles the scenario like now where we have a benchman as well as if there are separate keynote and annual chairmen. I spent some time working out the percentages so I can place the winner "magnets" on the globe and if I resize it it still works which will come in handy if I add any new views or modes.

You can [install it here](https://usetrmnl.com/recipes/97896), search "The Rickies" on the plugins page, or the code [is on GitHub](https://github.com/rknightuk/trmnl-the-rickies/tree/main).
