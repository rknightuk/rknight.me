Last week on the 'don [I said](https://social.lol/@robb/114502589160211103):

> is MTU dns related? Don't know, don't care, don't @ me

and [followed it up](https://social.lol/@robb/114502593595519553) with:

> "don't know don't care don't @ me" would make a good sticker, brb

I immediately set to work making this a reality because I wanted one but you can't just order a single sticker so I put together a plan: if I sell them at more or less cost[^1] I can have one, other people can buy one, and we can all have a nice time.

I thought about setting up a proper storefront to handle this because I like to over engineer things then I remembered that [Stripe payment links](https://stripe.com/gb/payments/payment-links) exist. So I setup [/shop](/shop) which lists all one of my things I'm selling and setup a redirect so that [/shop/dont-at-me](/shop/dont-at-me) goes to the Stripe checkout page.

For the pricing, I wanted to make sure I didn't lose money but I also want people to feel like they're getting something worthwhile so for $10 you get _two_ stickers shipped anywhere. I'm going to throw in some bonus stickers with everyone's order from my desk stash as well.

ðŸ‘‰ [Buy Don't @ Me stickers](/shop/dont-at-me)

These will be available to buy for another week or so and then I'll be ordering the stickers to get them sent out to everyone.

[^1]: "Cost" in this case accounting for the stickers and the stupid cost of postage to literally anywhere
