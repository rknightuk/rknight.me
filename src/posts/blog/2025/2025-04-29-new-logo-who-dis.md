Last week [Kevin](https://social.lol/@humdrum#.) posted about running [sponsorships on Foofaraw](https://foofaraw.press/sponsorship/) and I figured it would be a nice, small-scale experiment with running ads for [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) so I bought three slots. The problem was I _hated_ the EchoFeed logo and have done since the site launched. It does the job but it was put together last minute and I didn't have any better ideas at the time:

I figured I might as well have another crack at it if I was going to be running ads. I came up with this (definitely not very original) idea of the RSS logo being part of a circle, messed around for a while and came up with version one:

![Three circles but the right hand side is the RSS logo in orange](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/echofeed-logo-new-v1.jpg)

This was way better than the previous one and I sent a preview to Kevin and [Adam](https://neatnik.net) for some feedback. Kevin suggested making the circles get thicker as they go outwards and also perhaps a stylised "e" in the centre. I tried that and couldn't get an "e" that I liked, but it did force me to try some more ideas and settle on what is now the logo for EchoFeed:

I'm not designer so I can't pinpoint _why_ this is more pleasing to my eye, but I like it. I updated the site, [the 88x31 button](https://rknight.me/assets/img/buttons/echofeed.svg), the [Amplify account](https://beep.town/@echofeedamplify), and the [GTS account](https://hub.7622.me/@echofeed) with the new logo and now I have one I like, I can order some stickers.
