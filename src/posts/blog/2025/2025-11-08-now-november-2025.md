I'm hunting for the best pink ink to match with my [Funky Town Estie](https://www.esterbrookpens.com/products/funky-town-estie). As always, [Mountain of Ink](https://mountainofink.com/blog/pink-ink) is an incredible resource for such things and there was some good suggestions on [episode 690 of the Pen Addict](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/690).

We're organising Baby Knight II's first birthday party because the passage of time comes for us all and she's nearly a year old somehow which means it's nearly Christmas. wtf.

Perpetually thinking about redoing my website, but I want to find the perfect body font before I start. 

I'm trying out [Bloom](https://bloomapp.club) as a Finder replacement and I want to find some time to see how [Affinity](https://www.affinity.studio) works for vector work now it's free. Pixelmator is good, but isn't really built for it.

We've been rewatching a bunch of Marvel movies while we're a bit short on new shows to watch but we did start [Pluribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)) today.

Finally, I'm full steam ahead on a new KnightShift project - Project Rumble. No information for you, just the code name.
