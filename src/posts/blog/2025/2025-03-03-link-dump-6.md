A whole load of stuff this round, I've was ill a lot of last week, got very behind on everything, so here's all the hot links I had saved.

---

[The hardest working font in Manhattan](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/) is a deep dive into a font never designed to show up pretty much everywhere. 

[Making Software](https://www.makingsoftware.co/) is a new book by Dan Hollick but what struck me was the hard-drive illustration on the home page; it's gorgeous.

I used to archive Throwback Thursday playlists when I used Spotify but someone is doing it for [all sorts of public playlists over there](https://github.com/mackorone/spotify-playlist-archive?tab=readme-ov-file).

[Kevin wrote about](https://social.lol/@humdrum/114037621412211034) how he keeps a blank page in Pixelmator open all day to fill with nice messages and other things he comes across, then prints it to stick in a notebook. I love this idea. 

I also love [2024 in Stitches](https://jenschuetz.com/journal/2024-in-stitches/?v=1).

I happened across [track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) while remembering how [Thinkup](https://github.com/ThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp) would track a person's changes to their bio on Twitter.

[My Life in Weeks](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/) is fun. Not sure I want to do one though.

[A f\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*n in Severance...?!?](https://cjs-wunderkammer.ghost.io/a-f-n-in-severance-2/). Pen stuff becuase I'm a pen person now.

Adam had us all [fingering each other last week](https://rknight.me/notes/202502261007/) which led me down a rabbit hole of [the finger protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)) and eventually to [plan.cat](https://plan.cat). 

I don't recall how I found [Tweek Calendar](https://tweek.so/) but it's a "minimal to do list and weekly task planner app". One page per week, it's printable, good stuff.

[Strftime](https://strftime.net/) is a handy reference for formatting dates.

I don't know when I'll need to [create a CRT with CSS](https://aleclownes.com/2017/02/01/crt-display.html) but I'll find a reason to do it.

If such a thing as a Trump-proof stack exists if you're a US citizen [this is probably it](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/american-tech-is-compromised-heres-my-replacement-stack-2/).

I had no idea [Panel Editor](https://robservatory.com/create-macos-automations-using-a-little-known-app/) existed in MacOS and it looks pretty useful.

Finally [an indie web manifesto](https://www.uzine.net/article63.html) from 1997:

> We invite the users to realize the essential role they play on the Internet: when they start their own website, when they send comments, criticisms or warm letters to the webmasters, when they exchange tips and hints in the newsgroups or by e-mail, they provide an independent and free source of information that others would like to sell and control. Education, information, culture and debate can only come from users, independent webmasters, academic or associative organizations.
