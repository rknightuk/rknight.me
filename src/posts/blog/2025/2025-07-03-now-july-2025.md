It's been six months since [my last /now post](https://rknight.me/blog/now-january-2025/) which is, to [paraphrase Dan](https://social.lol/@rtfm/114788733214804190), really stetching the definition of "now".

In the previous post I said "_I'm dipping my toe into bullet journaling_" and I'm not just toe in now, I'm up to my neck in it. I was [on the Pen Addict](https://rknight.me/blog/i-was-a-guest-on-the-pen-addict/), I have a shit load of pens now, and I'm loving it. I'm about to move to a new journal having nearly filled up my current one (a [Scribbles that Matter](https://www.stm-eu.com/) one if you're curious).

[The stickers](https://rknight.me/blog/stickers-maths-and-postage/) are still arriving in various places including New Zealand this morning but I'm very happy with how the whole thing went. I'm already thinking about doing another pack next year, or even set up a proper online store.

I bought [a TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) (code `robb15` for $15 off) and I love it. So much so I've made five plugins that are in the directory as well as a couple just for me. [I wrote about it here](https://rknight.me/blog/one-week-with-trmnl/).

I started Clarkson's Farm season four yesterday but that's the only thing I've watched in at least a month or so.

Baby Knight II is six months old now so she's onto eating food and moving to her own room this week. I can't wait to get rid of the [Chico Next2Me](https://www.chicco.co.uk/cribs/chicco-next2me-forever-bedside-cot) from our bedroom.

I'm working on expanding the usefulness of EchoFeed to include rules which is being tested right now, profiles, and directly posting. 

I'm also planning someone other KnightShift-related things but those are secret for now.
