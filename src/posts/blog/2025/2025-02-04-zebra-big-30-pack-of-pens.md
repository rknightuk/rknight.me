I wanted to buy a pack of [mildliners](https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/discover-mildliner) to add some colour to my [bullet journal](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) and they mostly come in packs of five which is plenty for one person. When I googled to see who stocked them I saw [this 30 pack](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/312091022) that comes with 15 mildliners, 15 pens, and a natty pen holder and it was only Â£10 so if I'd be losing money if I didn't buy it[^1].

All the cool kids do little test pages so here you go, I did one at the back of my notebook. I _really_ like the vermilion and the smoke blue.
