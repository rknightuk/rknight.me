I really need a better structure for these. I find it so hard every year to remember what to include and in which section. Herein I shall attempt to define some kind of structure.

### General

I mostly just kept it together with the lack of sleep from having two children who refuse to sleep much, or at the same time. I did install a new electric awning at the back of the house so that was something. Not much else to report in this area.

### Writing - Online

This section has the "online" suffix because I also have the analog part of writing to talk about but they are very different things.

This is post 73 of the year; less than last year but a bit over 2023. My most popular _new_ posts this year were [Biting the Bullet](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) which I assume is because of how good the title is, [How Many Mildliner Colours Are There?](https://rknight.me/blog/how-many-mildliner-colours-are-there/) (a lot of traffic from search engines coming into this one), and [I Am Obsessed With this Tomb Raider Pen](https://rknight.me/blog/i-am-obsessed-with-this-tomb-raider-pen/) which of course I eventually bought. I'm very happy that [this post about the 8BitDo keyboard](https://rknight.me//blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/) is my most popular post in general now, no longer will I be plagued by [this stupid post](https://rknight.me/blog/convert-spotify-facebook-to-email-login/).

I started doing [weeknotes](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/weeknote/) numbered by the week of my life it is because I can't commit to weekly and I'm happy with how they've come out. They're a useful outlet to post about interesting things I find, like an internet Womble.

### Writing - Analogue

I started bullet journalling[^1] in January which led me to pens, pencils, paper, notebooks, inks, and everything in between. The actual journalling has been really useful in keeping track of things I need to do, ideas I have, things I might want to do. As of this month, I've finished two notebooks and I'll be starting a new one in January. 

I was on The Pen Addict [in March](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/657) and again [in October](https://www.relay.fm/penaddict/689) and I hope Brad will invite back again at some point because it was a lot of fun. I said it in another post but the pen community are all bloody lovely and welcoming.

I want to try and improve my lowercase handwriting because right now I exclusively write in capitals. 

As a direct result of journalling I ended up [drawing for St Jude](https://rknight.me/blog/get-okay/), participating in [Inktober](https://rknight.me/blog/inktober-completed-it-mate/), and inventing Jeff, a loveable dinosaur. [The sticker fun pack includes a Jeff sticker just fyi](https://knightshift.bigcartel.com/product/crazy-robbs-discount-fun-pack).

Because I only got started this year, I picked up _a lot_ of pens and other related things. I [reviewed some pens](https://rknight.me/blog/one-line-pen-reviews/), a [pen case](https://rknight.me/blog/lihit-labs-compact-pen-case-review/), and even [some sticky tabs](https://rknight.me/blog/bookaroo-sticky-tabs-review/) but the big one was my [Esterbrook Funky Town](https://rknight.me/notes/202510112037/) and [the hottest pink ink I could find](https://rknight.me/blog/hunting-for-the-hottest-pink-ink/). I love this pen so much.

I have my eye on a few other fountain pens for next year including a [Diplomat Viper](https://www.diplomat-pen.com/en/shop/diplomat/viper/) but I expect it will be a much slower year in terms of purchasing. 

### Travel

We did three holidays this year, the first time we've gone away with either of the kids. The first was to [Fisher's Farm](https://www.fishersfarmpark.co.uk/) in one of their cabins. This was exhausting for us and the kids because it's non-stop every day we were there but everyone had a great time. We then did 5 days at both Haven in Bognor and Butlin's, which is also in Bognor. The year of Bognor.

The one definitive conclusion we came to is that we are not "cook while we're on holiday" people. I never want to cook anywhere that isn't my kitchen, so we're just not going to any more. It'll cost more money, but less stress for me.

### Media

#### TV

Kids are not conducive to watching a lot of TV that requires attention but we were able to squeeze in [The Last of Us](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2025-05-26-the-last-of-us/), [Silo](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2025-03-01-silo/), and [High Potential](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2025-04-13-high-potential/). We also watched [Pluribus](https://rknight.me/almanac/tv/2025-12-24-pluribus/) but I have no idea how I feel about that show right now. We'll be straight into Fallout season two when that's all available too.

#### Movies

We ended up on a rewatch-the-MCU binge for most of the year because of the aforementioned lack of attention needed. Only four new movies this year:

- [Thunderbolts](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2025-10-04-thunderbolts/) - This was fine. If Florence Pugh wasn't in it this would be nothing.
- [Captain America: Brave New World](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2025-10-03-captain-america-brave-new-world/) - This was better.
- [Fantastic Four: First Steps](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2025-11-06-the-fantastic-4-first-steps/) - This was fun but very obviously a filler movie before Doomsday.
- [Freakier Friday](https://rknight.me/almanac/movies/2025-11-15-freakier-friday/) - I was so hopeful but this was awful.

#### Games

I played the Tony Hawk 3+4 Remaster and it's a solid effort but the new levels are just not very good. I don't care about the 4 career mode but it is a big missing piece.

#### Music

I became, I think there's no other word, obsessed with MGK. I was shown a preview of the [Cliché video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4DVbm9zeR0) on my Apple TV, I watched it and I loved it. Then I watched it 10 more times and listened to it, as of this writing, 200 more times. The whole album it's from, [Lost Americana](https://musicthread.app/link/310FLVKGKZHEkhNRv7DlOTcmgus), is incredible and then I went into his back catalog and listened to all that _all the time_.

I'm sure other music existed but MGK has been my 2025.

#### Books

Oh my God, Karen, you can't just ask people what books they read.

### Projects

#### KnightShift Studio

I decided KnightShift Studio was a better name than KnightShift Development because I'm a big sticker boy now and "studio" better encapsulates random ideas I might have outside of general development and web apps. Anything where money might change hands is filed, in my mind, under the KnightShift banner. Something something business.

- [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) is growing slowly and I've added a handful of new features including filtering rules and a shiny new logo. 
- [KnightShift sticker shop](https://rknight.me/shop) is up and running and has had some sales. I [wrote more about it here](https://rknight.me/blog/new-stickers-new-store-who-dis/).
- I designed this [Pen Addict Waffle House sticker](https://www.penaddict.com/shop/waffle-sticker) for Brad.

### Curios

- It's no [Humonize](https://hum.rknight.me) but [the Connected Outro Maker](https://outro.rknight.me/) is a fun little thing.
- I don't remember how I got the idea for [The Wellness Place](https://wellness.rknight.me/) but it exists.
- [Portal Kombat](https://portkom.rknight.me/) is Top Trumps but for boats, built at Hack Pompey. Related [blog post](https://rknight.me/blog/hack-pompey-portal-kombat/) here.
- The journalling really got me good and I ended up collecting all the Zebra Mildliners and building [this site](https://mildliners.rknight.me/) to track all the sets and colours. Then I did the same for the [Zebra ClickArt pens](https://clickart.rknight.me/).
- I had fun getting set up to [print directly from Big Cartel to my new thermal printer](https://github.com/rknightuk/thermal-label-formatter).

### Miscellanea

- A lot of the projects above I made new icons and illustrations for, like the Mildliner and Clickart SVGs. I've gotten a lot better at making these this year and it's opened up some fun possibilities.
- It was a year of printers and cameras - I [bought a Camp Snap](https://rknight.me/blog/camp-snap-impressions/), a [Kodak Charmera](https://www.kodak.com/en/consumer/product/cameras/digital/charmera-keychain-digital-camera/), a thermal printer for shipping labels, and a [Kodak P300](https://kodakphotoprinter.eu/products/best-photo-printer-kodak-mini-3-retro-1) instant printer. Oh and the [cat printer](https://rknight.me/blog/knightprints-first-run/) that I hooked up to the fediverse.
- Me and Adam [raised over $15k](https://rknight.me/blog/st-jude-2025-recap/) for St Jude this year, putting just under $50k raised over the past three years.

[^1]: Note the lowercase "B" and "J". The _brand_ is definitely not what it was even 12 months ago.
