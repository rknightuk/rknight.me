When I was at school there was no pencil case cooler than one that looked like a can of Pepsi, [Lucozade](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/wdfrih/drinks_can_pencil_cases/), or Coca Cola. At the time, I had a Pepsi Max one for a while but I had forgotten all about it until last week when I happened upon someone selling one on Vinted so of course I immediately bought it.

It arrived yesterday and it's as glorious as I remember.

Also, I made this based off another version of the logo for no reason other than it slaps[^1].
