excerpt: "I have a handful of magazines, books, and stuff here all from independent people from the internet and it's just...cool"

On my desk right now I have:

- A copy of issue one of [Good Internet magazine](https://goodinternetmagazine.com)
- [The Internet Phonebook](https://internetphonebook.net)
- The print version of [S3 of Foofaraw](https://foofaraw.metalabel.com/foofaraw-s3)
- [Unch](https://unchcrosswords.com) issue 1, a crossword magazine

All of these are made by cool people on the internet and I think that's pretty cool.
