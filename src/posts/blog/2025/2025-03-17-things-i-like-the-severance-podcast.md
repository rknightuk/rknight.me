I love hearing all the behind the scenes stuff but the guests really make the show. Gwendoline Christie in particular was incredible. I don't know where to link because the show doesn't have a website because big podcasts don't know how to podcast and [Audacy](https://www.audacy.com), who produce the show, has a website that "isn't currently available in the EU". I'm not in the EU Audacy but whatever.

Here's [the Apple podcasts link](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-severance-podcast-with-ben-stiller-adam-scott/id1788381175).
