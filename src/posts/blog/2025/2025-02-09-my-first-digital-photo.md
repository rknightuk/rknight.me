Adam [tooted earlier](https://social.lol/@adam/113969207723093283) about the first photo he ever took with a digital camera and it got me thinking about what mine was. Initially I thought it was this photo of Manhattan take from the Empire State Building in February 2006 taken with a [Fujifilm FinePix A345](https://www.dpreview.com/products/fujifilm/compacts/fuji_finepixa345z).

However, when I got onto a proper computer and I could check, I found this photo of my dad's MGZS which I took on his [Fujifilm DX 5](https://www.digitalkameramuseum.de/en/cameras/item/fujifilm-dx-5), a month prior to the New York photo.

A couple of years before at school I had used a [Sony Mavica FD75](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Sony_Mavica_FD75) - this fucker took a 3.5" floppy disk for storage. What a time to be alive. Sadly I don't have any photos from it but I suspect they were not good.
