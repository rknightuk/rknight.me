I [posted in July](https://rknight.me/blog/pilot-juice-planet-labyrinth-set/) about the Pilot Juice Planet Labyrinth set which are neon editions of the juice line. I had mentioned there was a second set called Space Smash and I picked those up this week.

![Three pens next to writing samples in yellow, blue, purple. Other samples are orange, pink, and green. The yellow is very hard to read](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/pilot-juice-space-smash.jpg)

The purple is great, blue is decent, but the yellow is nearly impossible to read - I thought the green was bad but yellow is much worse for readability.
