This is the first in a new series of posts to populate my /now page with a blog post. A moment in time. What I'm doing _now_. A record of what I _was_ doing.

Thanks to [Nic](https://niclake.me) this was really easy to do because I could copy what he does:

1. Tag a post with the [Now](/blog/tags/now)
2. Get the latest post tagged as such
3. Use that content on my /now page

I'm on paternity leave for another week or so with Baby Knight 2. Everything is twice as hard with a toddler around.

I'm [dipping my toe](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) into bullet journaling and it's going...fine? It's probably a little bit early to tell. What I do know is that my recomendations on YouTube are _ruined_ and I bought new pens.

My wife and I are watching the last two seasons of Young Sheldon. After that, she's agreed to watch The Last of Us with me. I've been dying to rewatch it.

I haven't got [a yearly theme](https://www.themesystem.com) but if I did have one it would be something like _"The Year of Being Whelmed"[^1]_. I want to stop be overwhelmed by the millions of choices of movies/tv shows/books/games/whatever and make a concious effort to _choose_ a thing. I don't have time to do everything, especially with two kids now. If I'm not sure of something, dump it, it doesn't need to be on the list. 

You know what, fuck it, I do have a yearly theme. It's that.
