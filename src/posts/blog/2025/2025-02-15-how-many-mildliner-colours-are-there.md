Remember [a week ago](https://rknight.me/blog/zebra-big-30-pack-of-pens/) when I bought some Zebra Mildliners? Well now I have all of them because I have no self control. But _how many are there?_. If you check the Zebra website, you'd see [this natty graphic](https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/mildliner-highlighter-color-chart?srsltid=AfmBOoqP8E9bStyvLEqug7cNSckEA_aZ2UecyVmE70DKhV0-SdpyOe_u) that shows there are 35 colours available across seven sets. You might also find [this "complete" set](https://www.afth.co.uk/zebra-pens---mildliner-set---35pk-50828-p.asp) and assume that 35 is the number but it's not.

There are actually 36 colours - there is an secondary version of the Neutral set called "Natural", which is sold in the Japanese market. This set has dusty pink, instead of copper. Dusty pink appears in some other sets (that aren't part of the core seven) so it's much easier to find that one separately, which is exactly what I did to complete my collection. 

Here's an updated version of Zebra's chart to include the variations:

As I was finishing this post, I did find official confirmation of 36 colours on Zebra's website[^1], in [this PDF](https://files.elfsightcdn.com/d1d61ad2-9f2a-49f9-a83b-e33cb46bd033/bf609a33-7e4d-45d9-84a9-53b4c96b500e/Mildliner_US-Japan_Cross_Reference.pdf) which is named `Mildliner_US-Japan_Cross_Reference`.
