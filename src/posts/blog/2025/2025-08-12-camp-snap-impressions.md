Firstly, there were [no cursed photos on it](https://rknight.me/notes/202508101036/). So that's good.

I've been wanting to get a [Camp Snap camera](https://www.campsnapphoto.com) for a while but they're kind of pricey for what they are so I'd been holding off. Then I happened upon a listing on Vinted for one for £10 which is _much_ cheaper than the £40-50 they usually go for even second hand _and_ it was the pink one.

Camp Snap is a no-screen digital camera design to "keep you in the moment" or something equally wishy-washy. I wanted it because it looked fun and it's perfect for the kids to use. I'm not sure how much of a beating this thing can take but there's not a lot of moving parts to it so it'll probably be fine.

Despite thinking the premise is a bit wishy-washy, I actually _did_ enjoy the fact that I wasn't checking every photo to make sure it was perfect or that afterwards I couldn't just go in and choose a new frame from the live photo. Live photos are great and I wouldn't do without them but it definitely makes having a spontaneous photo a little bit less spontaneous. "In the moment" you might say. Fuck, they got me.

You can install custom filters either from [Camp Snap directly](https://www.campsnapphoto.com/pages/v103b), or by making your own with their [custom filter maker](https://filters.campsnapphoto.com). I tried out a couple and I really like their vintage one. There's also a selection of filters available on [Camper Snapper](https://campersnapper.com/filters) and [Camp Shades](https://www.campshades.com) which I've downloaded to try out in the future.

Depending on what model you have depends on how you install the filters - I luckily ended up with 103B, a more recent one but to find out the model everywhere on their site says "check the box" but I didn't have the box so how the hell does one work out which model they have? It's in the photo metadata. Why they don't mention this anywhere is beyond me.

Because of the bargain price I got mine for, I'm loathed to spend the same amount again on their [wrist strap/USB C cable](https://www.campsnapphoto.com/collections/accessories/products/dual-function-camera-wrist-strap-usb-c-data-cable) but that is a very cool product. If somewhere in the UK is selling those, I might grab one.

I also came across [SNPSHT](https://snpsht.com/products/snpsht-screenless-digital-camera-black) which appears to be basically the same product. 

Anyway, I like this camera. I'd forgotten how much fun it is to just _take some photos_ I'll be trying out some more of the filters soon.
