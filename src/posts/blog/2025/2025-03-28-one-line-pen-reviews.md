There's no way I can write reviews of all the pens I’ve bought over the past two months so instead here's some one line reviews of them because I told [Brad](https://www.penaddict.com/) I'd do it. Some general things I've realised:

- I much prefer smaller nibs, gotta be 0.7 or less, ideally 0.5
- I like pink and purple pens but tbh anything that isn't black or white I'm into
- Yellow ink is a bit rubbish

Anyway, here we go.

![A notepad with samples of all the different pens. Some of the pens are on the left hand page.](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/one-line-reviews-pens.jpg)

### Standard Pens

**Uni-Ball Jetstream, various colors**: Very nice

**Uni-Ball Jetstream Lite**: Also nice

**Uni-Ball One**: Lovely ink

**Zebra Z-Grip 1mm**: Too thick for me

**Iconic gel ink**: Amazing colors, really nice to write with

**Zebra Mark On**: These are bloody great. The 0.4 is a bit too scratchy for me though.

**Spoke Click Model C**: Hefty, feels great in the hand. Swapped in a Parker .55 gel refill.

**Muji .38 Gel**: Very nice, doesn't feel scratchy to write with like the 0.4 mark on.

**Uni-Ball EMOTT**: Smooth but I've not used these much yet.

**Uni-Ball Pin fineline and Sakura Pigma Micron**: Not used either of these yet but I got the microns in the black and gold edition because they're pretty.

**Energel**: It had Pikachu on so I had to buy it. Smooth writing.

**Muji retractable highligher**: A _retractable_ hightlight? Now I've seen everything. Nice color on this one.

**Zebra Mildliners**: [Fuck yes](https://rknight.me/blog/how-many-mildliner-colours-are-there/).


### Fountain Pens

**Platinum Preppy 03**: I like these, just don't bother with the yellow ink, it sucks.

**Lamy AL-Star**: I'm definitely leaning towards preferring the metal AL-Star over the Safari but I need to use them both a bit more to fully pick a side. I currently have the Fiery and Pacific Blue in rotation.

**Lamy Safari**: As above, still nice. Currently I have pink, green, and yellow.

### Pencils

**Uni Kuru Toga 0.3mm**: Another one I bought because of Pikachu. 0.3 is too small for a pencil for me.

**Tombow mono graph**: Nice enough, it's a pencil.

**Sun-Star Metacil retractable**: I'd not heard of "forever pencils" before, this one is cool.

**Pentel P203/P205/P207/P209**: These are bloody lovely, 7mm is perfect for general use for me.


### Miscellany

![Multiple notepads spread out on a desk](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/one-line-reviews-notebooks.jpg)

**Ottergami Dotgrid A5**: A5 is the perfect size for a bullet journal for me but the paper in this isn't as nice as I'd like. Will be switching to something else when it's finished.

**Paperian Memo Pad**: It's cute.

**Life Noble notepads**: I have an A5 and a B7, the paper is glorious to write on.

**Traveler's "Let’s Go on a Road Trip" notebook**: This is the one I can't bring myself to use yet. It's just so nice.

**Lihit Lab compact pen case**: [I love it, I reviewed it here](https://rknight.me/blog/lihit-labs-compact-pen-case-review/)

I also have some tape I like:

- Traveler's Factory boarding pass
- World Craft Peek-a-Boo cats
- Generic pink

So...yeah. That's a lot of pens in a short period of time.
