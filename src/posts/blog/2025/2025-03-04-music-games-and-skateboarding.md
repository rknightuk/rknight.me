For Christmas 2001 I got a Playstation 2 and a copy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3[^1]. I had played Tony Hawk 1 and 2 at a friend's house a handful of times but I'd never spent significant time with either of the games.

That Christmas break I spent every waking moment playing. This was the first time I'd been obsessed with a video game. I'd go to bed thinking about it, wake up thinking about it, and spend days at school thinking about how to get better scores or where the hidden tape might be on the cruise ship. _Obsessed_.

Every run was two minutes and I must have done hundreds over the years which means I've listened to the first two minutes of some [absolute bangers](https://vgost.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Hawk%27s_Pro_Skater_3) _a lot_. To the point that when I'd eventually listen to the full tracks I'd be surprised to hear anything past 120 seconds. The soundtracks to all of the games are iconic[^3]. I went and [saw Zebrahead live](https://rknight.me/almanac/events/2008-10-16-zebreahead/) as a direct result to hearing them in this game. I still listen to most of the bands to this day[^2].

I, along with everyone else back, took up skateboarding because of the games.

This is why I'm so excited for the [3 and 4 remaster](https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com). It shaped my love of video games _and_ music[^4].
