I've played a good ten or so hours with the new Tony Hawk game and it does more or less what was promised, and what I expected. The game plays just like the 1+2 remaster, no surprises there. 

Bam is back ðŸ¥³.

I'm surprised how little of the original soundtrack made it to this version but the most of the new tracks are very good. I made a [playlist on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-remaster/pl.u-WR7GIdBJpqv).

There's some Back to the Future themed boards and clothing to unlock so of course I need them all. I have the board, wheels, and the life preserver so far.

Carnival isn't there at all in THPS4. It's not my favourite level by any stretch but it was a solid one and it's exclusion is noticeable. I don't care about Chicago being missing though, that was always a bad level.

There's a cash nugget on a flying remote control plane in Suburbia and it shows a complete lack of understanding of the series. There's no line to skate to get this; it feels totally out of place.

The skitching tutorial is _wild_ â€” revert off a skitch? Chaos.

I have 20 years of muscle memory in these games so it's hard to judge the new levels but I'll give it a go:

- Movie studio: I think there might be some good lines here but they weren't immediately obvious. It's _fine_.
- Water Park: This one is great. At first glance it looks chaotic but actually there are some solid skating lines here.
- Pinball machine: It's fun but it's a bit too chaotic for my liking.

The biggest change is the lack of the THPS4 career mode and if I'm honest I don't really miss it. THPS4 was _crazy difficult_ and filled with crap goals. I'd still prefer a full remake if only to experience it at higher quality but I don't care all that much.

I haven't completed the pro goals yet but it seems like you can't do the goals once for each skater but I didn't look that hard.

I also got this hilarious bug in the LA earthquake cut scene where the car was missing.
