There was a post on Reddit yesterday that I didn't save, and now can't find, that said something along the lines of "I'm trying out Mastodon but my timeline is too quiet". 

One of the comments noted the lack of algorithm on Mastodon which led me to a realisation that seems obvious in hindsight: no matter if you follow one person or a thousand, the algorithm-driven social media platforms will make sure there's _always_ stuff in your timeline. Even if you follow no one, you're getting a full timeline.

No conclusion to draw here, just an observation.
