It's [nearly effectively September](https://isitseptember.fyi/), everything is ready and standing by for the start of Relay's annual podcastathon and fundraising event. We have some excellent stickers this year.

I'm not one for music videos unless it's OK Go but Apple Music on my TV kept showing me a preview of the video for [Cliche by mgk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4DVbm9zeR0) so I gave it a watch. Not only is the song a banger, the video is just so good. I can't pinpoint what it is but I love it. mgk seems like a complete ding dong of a person but he is stupidly talented.

[Throwing a tire in a sand dune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpQ5bcxouw) is lovely.

[One Million Screenshots](https://onemillionscreenshots.com/?q=rknight.me) is a lot of screenshots of websites and my site is there so that's fun. 

This video, [_how to document your life with your camera_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gScghz6pQjM) (via [Maaike](https://www.maaikebrinkhof.nl/author/maaikebrinkhof/)]) is making me want to do more photography. Do I have the time for a new hobby? Do I bollocks but that's never stopped me before. Time to charge the DSLR.

It's great to have [Pebble back](https://ericmigi.com/blog/pebble-time-2-design-reveal).

[Nic](https://niclake.me) pointed me towards the [Savannah Bananas](https://shop.thesavannahbananas.com) which led me to [this Party Animals hat](https://shop.thesavannahbananas.com/products/party-animals-5950-alternate-hat-pink?variant=44364844892398) which I want, but don't want to double the price once you add shipping in.

[This album cover](https://slime-city.bandcamp.com/album/national-record-of-achievement) is the most British thing ever and [I want it](https://slimecitymusic.bigcartel.com). (via [Ben](https://bendaubney.com))
