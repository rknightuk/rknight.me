excerpt: "The breakdown of cost and profit on the stickers"
---

A few days ago, I put ~60 envelopes in the postbox to be whisked away to various places across the world. 

![A notepad with stickers on top. An RK logo with a sparkle background on the top left, two websites stickers on the left with a glitter background, and at the bottom two stickers that say don't know don't care don't @ me.](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/stickers-on-notebook.jpg)

I got 63 orders in total for [the stickers](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/) (plus two duplicates I refunded), 13 in the UK and 50 international. There were orders from 12 countries and my profit from this was around £175. To be clear, profit wasn’t the motivator here, I just wanted these stickers to exist but I also think there’s a lack of openness from people when it comes to money and business and all that fun stuff.

Here was my first pass at the numbers:

```txt
£468.48 in orders
Stickers £95
Envelopes £15
UK postage (1.70 × 13): £22.10
International postage (3.20 × 50): £160
Profit: £176.38
```

This was much better I originally thought but then I remembered that when I set the price at $10 I was accounting for just sending two of the "Don't @ Me" stickers - the "Websites" one was a bonus because I'd rather send some sparkly website stickers to people than make an extra bit of money. Nevertheless, if I account for me being a moron the profit is even better:

```txt
Stickers: £55
Profit: £216.38
```

Keep in mind of that £216, I still have to pay tax on it so it’s probably more like £100-£150 profit so not _nothing_ but I’m not quitting my job any time soon. 

I spent quite a few hours writing out envelopes (while my wife packed the stickers) and notes for the cards, I could definitely have sped this up if I had labels I could chuck in the printer. Maybe next time. 

I also bought too many envelopes and over-ordered a little bit on stickers but thankfully I sold the extra packs. 

I don’t know what conclusion to draw from this experience but it’s pretty cool that something I designed and made is out in the world and hopefully on MacBooks, notebooks, and whatever else in the next few weeks. If you bought some, thank you. And send me photos.
