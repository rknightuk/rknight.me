Last week I happened across a listing for a Lara Croft/Tomb Raider Waterman fountain pen, specifically this model:

We discussed it in [the omg.lol](http://rknight.me/save/omglol) discord and I said:

> Why was it made? Who is it for? What market analysis led them to produce such an item
>
> Who bought this? It wasn’t given away, someone paid money for it

[Lewis](https://lewisdale.dev) pointed out it was me. I was the target market. He was right. I spent a long time thinking about if I wanted to spend £35 on this pen and ultimately decided it is ugly as fuck so I didn't. Then I thought maybe I did and I kind of still do. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm obsessed.

I looked around to find out some more info about this pen and it turns out there were three designs available applied to fountain pens and a ballpoint as you can see in this natty...website? DVD menu? Not a clue to be honest. These photos came from [this core design page about the pens](https://core-design.com/merchandising_pens.html).

There's a bunch of different options including this set with some kind of "build your own desktop" software on it. _INSTALL ME IF YOU DARE_. Scary.

I kind of want one of these purely for the weirdness of it but what I _really_ want is this: the signature limited edition. Now _this_ is a classy pen[^1]. Having said that, I don't know what these sell for (there's no sold listings on eBay to reference) and I suspect it'll be more than I'll want to pay. If anyone has one of these knocking about, let me know.
