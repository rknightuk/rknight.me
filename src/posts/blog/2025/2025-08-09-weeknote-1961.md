We had to return [the Kodak C300R](https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1956/) because it kept overheating and not printing. We replaced it with the P300R which is what we were originally going to buy anyway.

I bought a [Nahvalur Original Plus](https://nahvalur.com/collections/nahvalur-original-plus) but sadly had to return it because it had a faulty nib and/or feed. I was going to get a replacement but I'm putting the money towards a [Esterbrook Funky Town](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DM3LVv4xIoc/) instead.

One of the notes in my ideas list reads "_Apple Music presence on Discord?_" and I can tick that off now because someone else did it. [Music Presence](https://github.com/ungive/discord-music-presence) works with Apple Music, Spotify, Doppler, and loads of other music services and it works on MacOS and Windows[^1].

Speaking of music, Jimmy Fallon and Lin-Manuel Miranda did a [Hamilton medley with classroom instruments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm11xB9aH8E).

Continuing on music, there are a shitload of new albums out this week: [Good Charlotte](https://musicthread.app/link/30zqvrNcHfFwZmuEMX8Lk9Pd0ca), [Attack Attack!](https://musicthread.app/link/30zuVd67R21g0o6XMiruYm37CuB), [Babymetal](https://musicthread.app/link/30zzhz7NDix6bzGmcvWWmoLYiIG), [Halestorm](https://www.halestormrocks.com), and [mgk](https://store.machinegunkelly.com). Babymetal's is particularly good.

[Baseline](https://github.com/aaaaalexis/obsidian-baseline), a new Obsidian theme, is really nice.

This "design exploration" called [the monospace web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/) is bloody lovely as is this "typographic experiment" called [flexflex](https://ronikaufman.github.io/flexflex/).

Finally, after going on a bit of tear yesterday on the 'don, I have [new stickers for sale](https://rknight.me/shop/training-data). I'll put up a proper post next week.
