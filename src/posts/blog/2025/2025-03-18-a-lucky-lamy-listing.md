A few days ago while browsing [Vinted](https://www.vinted.co.uk/) I happened upon a listing with the title "_Ink Pens_" and a description: "_6 ink pens with some spare cartridges_". The photo with the listing clearly showed Lamy cartridges but there wasn't an easy way to determine if the pens were legit Lamy Safaris/AL Stars or just very good replicas (of which I've seen quite a few on Vinted).

The blue one on the far right was the only one I was reasonably sure was a Lamy because of the logo engraving on it but I wasn't 100% convinced. Having said all that, the listing was £7 including postage so I figured it was worth the risk and it turns out I was right.

The parcel arrived this morning and aside from getting some extra cartridges on top of what was in the photo, there were three Safaris and three AL Stars. The AL Star colours are Ocean Blue, Black Purple, and _I think_ Pacific Blue but it could also be Turmaline. If anyone knows for sure let me know.

All the Safaris were dried up but I was able to get pink and yellow up and running again. Green is going to need a more thorough cleaning. For £7 this was an absolute bargain and I still can't quite believe my luck.
