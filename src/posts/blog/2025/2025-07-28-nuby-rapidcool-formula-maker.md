When you have a kid you're bombarded with suggestions for products that will solve some problem you have, usually related to keeping said child fed and watered and from my experience most of these are bollocks. Maybe they're slightly better than the alternative way but never enough to justify the cost[^1].

My wife had mentioned the [Nuby RapidCool](https://uk.nuby.com/products/rapidcool-portable-baby-bottle-maker) a few times and I was dubious: they claim to make formula the correct temperature, from boiling water, in under two minutes. We went ahead and ordered them anyway despite my doubts and to my surprise they actually do what they say. Chuck the formula and water in, shake it up, wait until it lights up green and you're done.

It's been really handy to be able to have formula ready that quickly. Previously we'd be in the 10 minute range to have something ready, now it's under three minutes. The lid, which is the bit with the thermometer in it, doesn't have a user-replaceable battery so it either runs on magic, or it's gunna die at some point. That's the only thing that bothers me about it but by that point hopefully we won't need it any more.
