I've narrowed down the inks I'm going to try for finding my perfect pink ink to a handful. I'm planing on ordered [Taccia Momo](https://mountainofink.com/blog/taccia-momo-pink) first because this is the one that's been recommended to me the most. I also updated my [ink list on FPC](http://www.fpc.ink/users/95147).

I've added some more pens to my wanted list including the [Diplomat Viper](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2025/3/30/diplomat-viper-fountain-pen-review), the [Monteverde MP1](https://cultpens.com/collections/monteverde-mp1), and the new [TWSBI Eco Cosmos Blue with Onyx](https://cultpens.com/products/twsbi-eco-fountain-pen-cosmos-blue-with-onyx). I also found somewhere selling the discontinued Pink Eco at retail price so I might need to buy that first.

I managed to find the time to go to the [Analog Tools meetup](https://cygnoir.net/analog-tools-meetups) where I got to talk to some wonderful people and also [said something very silly](https://rknight.me/notes/202511151813/).

I've backed [Bonfire on IndieGoGo](https://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/bonfire/community) because I'm fascinated by what they're trying to do.

Despite not being an iOS developer (nor do I have any intention of becoming one), [Everything but the Code](https://twostraws.gumroad.com/l/everything-but-the-code/blackfriday25) is 50% off for Black Friday and aside from some app-specific things, seems like it'll have a lot of useful stuff in it.

### Links

[Flare](https://flareapp.moe) is a new unified app for connecting to multiple social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky. I don't I need this but it's interesting nonetheless. 

[Grila](https://lowtechguys.com/grila/) is a keyboard-driven calendar app for MacOS which reminds me a lot of [Godspeed](https://rknight.me/save/godspeed).

[Taking stock of my tools](https://bapsi.micro.blog/2025/11/14/taking-stock-of-my-tools.html) by Britney Winthrope is a great post with an new (to me) way of categorising tools you use (the CODE framework - Capture, Organize, Distill, Express).

[The Ollee watch](https://www.olleewatch.com) is back in stock but I resisted for the time being.

[These Japanese firework illustrations](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/japanese-fireworks-catalogues/) are gorgeous. This also led to me to find [Affinities](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/affinities-a-journey-through-images-from-the-public-domain-review-adam-green/6233224?ean=9780500025208&next=t&affiliate=9706) which is a book by The Public Domain Review. Right onto my wishlist that goes.

[Mutant Standard emoji](https://mutant.tech/demo) is a fun new emoji set.
