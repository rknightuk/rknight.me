I resisted as long as I could, gang. I bought the [tomb raider pen I couldn't stop thinking about](https://rknight.me/blog/i-am-obsessed-with-this-tomb-raider-pen/).

I got it for £25 which quite frankly seems like a bargain given the rarity of it — if it wasn't so ugly, I suspect this would sell for a lot more. It didn't come with the original ink cartridge it was sold with (it's 25 years old so that's reasonable) so I grabbed [a converter on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000WKM50G) and filled it with [Diamine Havsu Turquoise](https://mountainofink.com/blog/diamine-havasu-turquoise).

The box I got is a bit knocked about but no more than to be expected give it's age, there's some ink on the barcode label, plus a couple of damp spots inside the box. It is absolutely as ugly as it looks in photos and it's quite light compared to my Lamy AL Star or even the Safari. This one came with a medium nib which writes thicker than a Lamy medium so it's not ideal for what I like but it is nice to write with in general.

I don't think anyone should buy this pen — there are loads of better options out there. That said, I still want that [signature edition one](https://rknight.me/blog/i-am-obsessed-with-this-tomb-raider-pen/).
