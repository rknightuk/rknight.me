excerpt: "A debate about islands that got a little bit out of hand"
---

Firstly, I'd like to thank my right honorable friend for giving me an advanced copy of her post.

A few months ago, as we are want to do, [Zoe](https://zoeaubert.me) and I got into a heated discussion about if Portsmouth is an island or not. Then [she went a bit overboard in this post](https://zoeaubert.me/blog/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/) correcting me about the density of Portmouth's population which is fair enough because I was misled by Wikipedia. 

The second half of her post, however, is nothing short of lunacy, claiming Portsmouth isn't an island because you could get there using [shank's pony](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/shanks-s-pony):

> If you can walk to it, itâ€™s not an island

An outrageous claim. I'd like to paraphrase the great Haddaway and also start like a really crap best man's speech:

What is ~~love~~ an island? [Merriam-Webster defines it as](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/island):

> a tract of land surrounded by water and smaller than a continent

so does the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/island):

> a piece of land completely surrounded by water:

and [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/island), [Collins English Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/island), [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/island), and [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/island/). And _every other dictionary in the land_ including the Chambers School Dictionary I got given by my English teacher when I left school[^1]:

![A dictionary definition of island](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2025/island-definition-chambers-school-dictionary.jpg)

Even school children know what an island is. Portsmouth is, last time I checked, smaller than a continent. It's also surrounded by water.

There is no definition I could find that has a caveat of "If you can walk to it, it's not an island". The [tidal island list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_island) Zoe mentioned in her post is lacking a vital entry: Portsmouth.

While writing this, I _did_ came across some anti-island propaganda from none other than the biggest tech company in the world. Apple Maps does not show Portsmouth as an island. Shenanigans! I shall be emailing Tim Apple post haste[^2].

Anyway, you don't get to argue with the dictionary, Zoe. Words mean things. Island means surrounded by water. Like Portsmouth.
