It's been a while since [my last weeknote](https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1966/) and it's fine - this is why I'm not committing to doing them weekly.

We are hurtling towards the end of the year and I realised I haven't been taking notes for my [year in review](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/yearinreview/) post so I've hastily thrown some notes together but I'm sure I will miss something important when I eventually write it.

I don't have McDonald's all that often but I tried the garlic & black pepper nuggets last week - they were pretty good. I also had the Sakura Cherry Blossom × Sprite which was delicious.

On a note of better food, I've been trying to branch out a bit from the ten or so meals we always cook. I've been watching a bunch of [Sip and Feast](https://www.youtube.com/@SipandFeast) videos and tried out a couple of recipes, the first of which was [this garlic butter chicken](https://www.sipandfeast.com/garlic-butter-chicken-bites/). The videos on Sip and Feast are really good, easy to follow and all the recipes are also on their website which is handy.

This has led me to assess my saucepans, frying pans, and other kitchen stuff and I am ready to replace everything with stainless steel - most of what we have is fairly cheap and some of it is falling apart. [Pro Cook](https://www.procook.co.uk/) is the top candidate right now but I'm going to their shop at some point to have a proper look at it before I buy anything.

A few interesting videos I watched while on this food kick:

- [Is Chipotle a Waste of Money?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkXCrGhWB04) - ignore the clickbait title, this is an interesting look at the cost of food when you include the cooking and travel time.
- [The Pantry Staples I SPLURGE on (and the Ones I DON’T)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2HYL5AHkcs).
- [How to Cook With Stainless Steel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-_FnU9FaeA)

I have a big list of EchoFeed features and bugs to deal with that I will get to as soon as I have time so if you're waiting for a response from me, I apologise.
