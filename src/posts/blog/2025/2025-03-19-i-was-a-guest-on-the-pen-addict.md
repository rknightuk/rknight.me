While [Myke is on paternity leave](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGdjaEDCcby/), Brad asked me to be a guest on The Pen Addict podcast to discuss my [newly-found analogue tool addiction](https://rknight.me/blog/tags/analogue/).

We discussed the upcoming [special edition Lamy Al Stars](https://www.penchalet.com/fine_pens/fountain_pens/lamy_al-star_special_edition_fountain_pen.html) and [related inks](https://www.penchalet.com/ink_refills/fountain_pen_ink/lamy_special_edition_bottle_fountain_pen_ink.html), and the [Caran dâ€™Ache Black Edition](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHIqirRsZj8/) before getting into my journey into bullet journaling, pens, pencils, and notebooks.

Since recording the show on Sunday, I got [six more Lamy fountain pens](https://rknight.me/blog/a-lucky-lamy-listing/).
