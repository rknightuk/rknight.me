Shawn Blanc [said it](http://shawnblanc.net/2011-07-sight-unseen/), so did [that survey](http://apple.slashdot.org/story/11-07-26/1440246/35-Consumers-Want-iPhone-5-Sight-Unseen) and so did [hundreds of people on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/search/want%20iphone%205). And now, so am I. I would buy the iPhone 5 based on nothing more than Steve Jobs saying "_It's available from next week_". Don't need to see it. I want it. Now. I have 100% faith in Apple to give us the best possible experience without playing the "_my smartphone has more rams, gigabytes and pixels than yours_" game. I Want. It. Now. Please? Someone actually said to me that their smartphone had "_more rams_" than my iPhone. Yeah, it probably has. And what?
