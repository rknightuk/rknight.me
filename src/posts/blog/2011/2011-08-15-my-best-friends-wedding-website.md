A few months ago, one of my best friends told me he was getting married in March. Being the geek that I am, my first thought wasn't about getting a new suit, buying them a present or even where I would stay after the reception (it's out of town); my first thought was "_Oooh wedding website_". I'd seen a few articles on the subject so I offered to create one for them, which also negated the need to buy them a gift.[^1]

After a lengthy discussion and lots of Googling, myself and the groom decided on the following pages:[^2]

  * Home page, obviously
  * The Ceremony - Where it is, directions, map, photo
  * The Reception - As above
  * Events - Dates and locations of the stag and hen nights as well as the wedding and reception
  * The Day - An itinerary of the entire day, available as a calendar download
  * Travel and accommodation - These pages are pretty self explanatory
  * The Bridal Party - Photos and names of all those in the bridal party (Best man, Maid of Honour, Ushers and Bridesmaids)
  * Contact

Between us we also decided that things like a guestbook and online RSVP would be no good as <s>a large majority of the guests</s> the older family members wouldn't use these as features. A couple of the online-specific features we did implement were a song request form and a countdown timer through some simple PHP code.

The website is mobile browser compatible through media queries along with a custom icon when saving to an iPhone/iPad home screen. I also created email addresses for the bride and groom for those who need to get in contact with the couple: _thegroom@example.com_

And there were a couple of final touches: I used a couple of fonts ([Lobster Two](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lobster+Two) and [Nixie One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Nixie+One)) from the [Google font directory](http://www.google.com/webfonts) as well as creating a print stylesheet for the site.[^3]

As far as the final product goes, I'm fairly happy. As a student web developer, projects like this give me an outlet to practice my somewhat limited (at the moment) skills and in my honest opinion, I believe that in the next three to four years, wedding websites will be a staple of any ceremony.

[^1]: I will still buy them a gift, I'm kidding. Honestly.  
[^2]: Other pages considered were 'Our story', 'Photos' which was not needed due to the power of Facebook and 'Gifts' again, unnecessary as they weren't asking for gifts.  
[^3]: Every time you don't use a print stylesheet when creating a website, a unicorn dies.
