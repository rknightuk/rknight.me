If you've upgraded to iTunes Match you may notice a <s>small</s> massive issue with scrolling in iTunes. Scroll a bit and iTunes will continue to scroll without any input from you. Thanks to [this forum post](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1290828&page=2) there is a solution. Simply turn off the "iCloud download" column in the file browser and the scrolling issue goes away. Hopefully Apple will fix this in a future update, but for now this will solve it.
