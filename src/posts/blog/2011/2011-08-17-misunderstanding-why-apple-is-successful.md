Kyle Baxter, on Apple's success: 

> "When competitors saw that the iPad was selling so strongly, they decided that they needed to sell a tablet device, too, because they thought Apple was selling a ton of iPads because it is a tablet. They didnâ€™t understand that people are actually buying them because the iPad is a confluence of purposefully-designed hardware and software. So they put Windows and Android-powered devices on the market, and sold very few devices."

Amen to that. [Misunderstanding Why Apple Is Successful](http://tightwind.net/2011-08-misunderstanding-why-apple-is-successful/) via [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net/2011-08-baxter-success/)
