On tab placement:

> "There are a few bene­fits to kee­ping the tabs to your left, other than free­ing space ver­ti­cally. First of all, we can make the tabs them­sel­ves a lot big­ger while still being able to fit a whole bunch of them in a single brow­ser win­dow, espe­ci­ally if we’re tal­king full screen win­dows like in Lion."

I really like the concepts and this is probably available through a few extensions.
