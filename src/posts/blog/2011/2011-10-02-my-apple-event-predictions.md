5 minutes ago, I was writing a somewhat sarcastic post about what's going to 'happen' on Tuesday at the Apple Event. I finished the first draft and then I stopped to check my RSS feeds. At the time I stopped I had written the following: 

> So the Apple event is two days away and everyone's questioning, analysing and generally just guessing about exactly what Apple will, or won't, announce on Tuesday. Here's how I think it's going to go down: 
> 
>   1. I will be trying to watch a live stream of the event, if it's available, but will inevitably end up following a live blog/twitter account, because the stream will suck
>   2. A new iPhone will be announced which I will want. And people will moan because it won't have everything that has been rumoured. Then I will hassle my carrier until they tell me when I can have it. Then I'll order it.
>   3. iOS5 will be released. I will want it. I will download it ASAP.
>   4. I will mark everything as 'read' in Reeder for 2 days following the event. I saw it. I want it. Don't need to read about it.
> I don't care what features the new iPhone has; I will want it. I don't care how good iCloud is; I will want to play with it. I don't care how long my iOS5 download will take. I will want it immediately. And that is how my Tuesday evening will unravel. 

And then I saw [this post](http://512pixels.net/iphone-2011-predictions) from Stephen Hackett over at 512 Pixels, titled "_My Official Predictions for Apple’s iPhone Event on Tuesday"_

> * Apple will release something new that will be pretty good.
> * People will be disappointed, thanks to the insane rumor mill.
> * I will mark “All as read” in Google Reader after the event and order a new phone.

Pretty sure Mr Hackett must have been watching me while I wrote my post. Or we have the same sense of humour. It's probably that. Probably. _closes curtains_.
