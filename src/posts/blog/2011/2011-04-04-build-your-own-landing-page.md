Those of you who follow me on Twitter, or are friends with me on Facebook, know that I have a personal site, as well as a custom URL shortener. But many people choose third-party services such as [about.me](http://about.me) or [flavors.me](http://flavors.me), which are far easier to setup as well as maintain. So why do I go custom rather than choosing a third-party option?  

### Practice

Firstly, I am an aspiring web developer. So having my own server and home page gives me a platform to practice and hone my skills in the field. If I was using a third party service, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to try out HTML, CSS and PHP in a real world environment. It gives me a testing ground as well as projects and end goals to aim for.

### Flexibility

With a custom page I have the ability to change layout, colours, styles and every other element of my page whenever I want. Third party services are (somewhat) limited in what they offer in terms of customisation. Yes, you can change fonts, colours and backgrounds, but if I want to have a second, third or fourth page, such as 'projects' or 'contact', I need to find _another_ third party service for this. With my own site, I have many different sections which are all stored in one place and constantly backed up (God bless Dropbox).

### Lifespan

What if the third party landing page you use (e.g. About.me) goes bust? Or gets shut down? You're back at square one looking for a new 'host' for your home on the web. With a custom landing page, this isn't an issue.

### Tracking

Although some services offer traffic stats, not all of them do. With a custom site, I can use any number of tracking services to track visitors and traffic; I personally use Google Analytics. This also goes for my custom URL shortener. Admittedly, this is purely a vanity purchase, but before I owned the short URL, I did have a bit.ly account. By using bit.ly with my short URL, I can not only easily see which links are short URLs I have created, but I can track the amount of clicks on each link. I use this information to work out the sort of thing that people are and aren't interested in, and adjusted my sharing accordingly.1

### Sections

As I said before, having extra pages is a must for me when it comes to a landing page. Specifically for my [projects page](/projects). In this projects section, I have subpages as well as external links on the page. This gives me a flexible home for everything that I have worked on and allows friends (both real and online), as well as potential employers, to see the different things I have previously worked. Which brings me nicely onto employment.

### Employment and downloads

On my site, I have a downloads sections where anyone (but hopefully future employers) can download my CV and portfolio, as well as view online versions of these. It's 2011 and I think it's time to start moving away from paper CVs. These are updated by simply editing on my computer and saving them in my Dropbox folder. I then use the public Dropbox link to allow people to download the documents. Perfect.

### Downsides

Depending on your own preference, there are a couple of downsides that should be considered before you decide on setting up your own landing page: 

  1. Cost - Although relatively low-cost, it's not going to be free. A domain name will set you back a few quid a year and hosting can cost as much or a little as you choose, within reason. My hosting only costs me Â£1 a month from the guys over at [VealHost](http://vealhost.com), which I have [waxed lyrical about](http://therobb.com/2011-02-3124389459/) in the past.
  2. Time - Obviously, designing, coding and maintaining a custom landing page can take up a lot of your time. Try to allocate a day or two to set it up properly and getting it exactly how you want it.

So that's my reasons for going custom on my landing page and I think, if able, you should too. [Lifehacker has an excellent article](http://lifehacker.com/#!5636983/how-to-make-and-host-your-own-custom-personal-landing-page) on setting up a fast custom landing page which requires very little coding knowledge. Do you have a landing page at all? Or do you just send people to your Twitter or Facebook page? Let me know in the comments. 

[^1]: This doesn't mean I am trying to please everyone, but I have found that many people that follow me, also follow/subscribe to Gizmodo, for example, so I tend not to share links from there unless I feel a story/article is _really_ important.
