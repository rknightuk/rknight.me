According to [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-iphone-5-was-real-says-a-source-who-played-with-the-prototype-2011-11), there _was_ an iPhone 5 prototype being tested at Apple, with a larger screen. This would match up with reports throughout this year saying that's what was coming. But for one reason or another, they didn't release it. 

Apparently, Steve Jobs didn't want fragmentation, similar to the fragmentation that currently plagues Android developers with all the different sized screens available. So why would they release it next year? Surely, there would still be fragmentation? Yes, but if released next year, there would only be two screen sizes (presumably) supported by iOS: the current 960 by 480 that we have in the iPhone 4 and 4S, and the new size (whatever that will be). The 3GS' smaller resolution screen probably won't be supported by iOS6. Which is why I think they'll release a larger screened iPhone next year and why we "only" got the 4S this year.
