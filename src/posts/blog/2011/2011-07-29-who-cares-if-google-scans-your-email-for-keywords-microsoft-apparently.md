Everyone knows Google uses keyword scanning in Gmail to show 'relevant' ads to you in the sidebar. I use the word relevant loosely because honestly, I can't remember the last time I actually saw an ad and clicked it, but at least Google is trying.  Microsoft seems to think the scanning for keywords is a problem as shown in the video below. NB: According to [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-latest-google-compete-weapon-the-gmail-man/10217), Microsoft made no comment as to whether the video was made by them or not.   
  
So yeah, Microsoft don't like relevant ads.
