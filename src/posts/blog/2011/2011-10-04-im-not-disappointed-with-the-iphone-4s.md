So the announcement came and went, and no iPhone 5. Sort of. The new iPhone is called 4S, but it's still an amazing update.  Firstly, the camera has been significantly upgraded to an 8MP sensor. And I think the iPhone 4 photos are pretty good considering it's a phone, so the 4S is going to be crazy good. Secondly, it's jumped to the dual core A5 processor for doing all kinds of awesome stuff, like Siri voice assistant and playing console-quality games. The design is a solid design that still looks amazing over a year after it was released, so keeping it was a good move by Apple. Yes, they're will probably be a hardware upgrade next year, but right now, the 4S is exactly the right amount of upgrade. And anyone want to bet this _won't_ be the best selling phone for the next 12 months? Thought not. This is an iPhone 5. It's just happens to be called 4S.
