This is sad day for the technology world, and the world in general. Never again will Steve take to the stage to announce something incredible that thousands will queue for, or say "One More Thing" to the sound of gasps from every member of the audience or make a snide remark about Android during a keynote.  I found out on my iPhone. I looked at the tribute pages on my iMac. I'm writing this on my MacBook Pro. This shows how much of a profound impact he, and Apple, have had on my computing experience. And this is repeated with almost every Mac owner around the world. Many of the people I follow on Twitter wouldn't be doing what they do if it wasn't for Steve. 

> Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? We make tools for these kinds of people. While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

RIP, Steve.
