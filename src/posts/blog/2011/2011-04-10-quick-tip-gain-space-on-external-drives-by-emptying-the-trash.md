Have you deleted a load of files on an external drive, but still haven't gained any space? I had the same problem. Simply empty the trash and all that precious space will return.

Why does this happen? Basically, when you delete files from an external drive, they go into the trash. But the space for the files is allocated from the external drive. So once you empty the trash, the space is returned, ready for all those, ahem, big files you download.
