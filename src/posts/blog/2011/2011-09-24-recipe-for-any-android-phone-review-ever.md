>   * The screen is better, brighter and bigger than on previous devices.
>   * It’s thin, but not iPhone-thin.
>   * The OEM’s Android skin isn’t awesome, but in some places, it could be.
>   * The new launcher comes with lots of widgets that do things.
>   * 4G is cool, unless you like battery life. But damn, those 28 seconds of browsing are fast!
>   * The camera software still sucks. Also, FRONT-FACING CAMERA! Note: This can be swapped for “3-D!!!!” if the review requires it.
>   * While Android is open, there’s lots of crapware on this phone. Hello, VZContact Manager FREE!
>   * This may be the best Android phone yet, but if not, just wait a week or two.
>   * The current version of Android lacks some polish, but the next version of Android will be the one to have, we promise. It’s going to rival iOS. 
>   * Granted, this phone probably won’t ever get to run it.
