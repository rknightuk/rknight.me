Many of you may already know this, but I spent a long time looking for where Automator saves workflows and folder actions. So I thought I would post it up as I couldn't find any information about where they are saved. To find your workflows and folder actions navigate to `yourusername/Library/Workflows` And that's it. Hope this helps.
