I'm on the train home after a long but awesome day at [Teenweb Conference](http://teenwebconf.com) and thought I should write up some of my thoughts about the day.

Teenweb is running for the first time this year, organised by [Callum Hill](http://twitter.com/beingcallum) and [Henry Moulton](http://twitter.com/henryforshort). The day was made up by 7 sessions. Six of which were talks and presentations from various people and the final session was a panel discussion, which got <s>incredibly</s> somewhat heated towards the end. My personal favourites were [Ben Nunney's](http://bennunney.com) "_How to be an epic failure (and come out winning)_" and [Ted Nash's](http://tednash.co.uk) "_Making your own luck_". Just to look at Ben's beautifully crafted slides was worth the trip.

I got a chance to meet some amazing people especially Ted Nash and [Emma Walker](http://twitter.com/emmawalker01), who is without a doubt the friendliest person I have ever met and she spoke so passionately about business and entrepreneurship, both during her talk and in the lunch break.

The panel session discussed a number of topics including whether or not to attend university, the UK education system and media coverage of young entrepreneurs (which got very Jeremy Kyle at one point). ((I can't take credit for the [Jeremy Kyle reference](http://twitter.com/RhysTowey/status/145520657197826049)))

The day was truly inspiring and I will definitely be attending next year.
