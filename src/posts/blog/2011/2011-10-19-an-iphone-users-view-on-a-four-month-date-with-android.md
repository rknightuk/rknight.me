Ryan Heise: 

> It just isn’t as good as iOS to me. Some of it I can explain, some of it is just strange subtleties that add up to an unenjoyable, uninviting experience. But even now, after being back on iOS for a week, going back to use Android feels completely foreign, as if the previous four months never existed. I have no explanation for this other than iOS just works better for me. Maybe Android works better for some of you. I really can’t say. Though I still feel clueless about Android in a lot of ways, what I do know is I’m absolutely overjoyed to be using an iPhone 4S today.
