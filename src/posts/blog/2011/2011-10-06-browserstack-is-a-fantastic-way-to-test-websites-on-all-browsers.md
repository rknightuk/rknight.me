BrowserStack is a new beta web app for testing the compatability of websites across all the major browsers including IE 6,7,8 and 9; great for Mac developers who don't want to run an entire version of Windows just to test. BrowserStack is currently in beta, but you can request an invite on the home page. Mine only took a few hours from requesting it, so go check it out.
