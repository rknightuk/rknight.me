Seamless is an iPhone app that allows you to seamlessly switch music between your iPhone and Mac and vice versa, without losing your place. Check out the video after the break for a better understanding of exactly what it does.  Understand? Good. The first thing you need to do to set Seamless up is [download the app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seamless/id420768433?mt=8&ls=1) from the App Store. Then install the Mac client, which is [available in the Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seamless/id420802577?mt=12&ls=1). Now start playing music on your Mac and make sure you are connected to the same wireless network on your iPhone. When you open up Seamless on your iPhone, you will need to add your Mac. Once this is done, Seamless will show what is playing on your Mac and you are given the option to _Transition Music from Mac_. Press this and the music will continue playing on your iPhone, right where it was on your Mac. Note: You must have the music you want to transtion to on both your Mac, and your iPhone. 

And that's it. Seamless also work from iPhone to Mac, so if you come home and want to continue playing the music from your iPhone, simply open up Seamless again, and press _Transition Music to Mac_. Seamless is available in the iTunes App Store for Â£1.19 [[iTunes link](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/seamless/id420768433?mt=8)] and the Mac client is free from the Mac App Store [[App Store link](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seamless/id420802577?mt=12&ls=1)].
