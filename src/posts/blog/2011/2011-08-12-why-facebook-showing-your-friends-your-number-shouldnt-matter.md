So when you sync your Facebook contacts with your address book, Facebook keeps all the numbers in 'contacts' on your account. There's a lot of misunderstanding of this feature, so much so they have [released a statement](http://mashable.com/2011-08-11/facebook-phone-numbers/) explaining the situation. So that's that cleared up.  Here's what has annoyed me about the whole situation. First off, it's called synchronisation. What did people think was going to happen? Secondly, the uproar seems to be about the misunderstanding that all of your Facebook friends will be able to see your phone number. Which they can't. But why the hell shouldn't they? If they're your friends, then surely they would be someone who would want or even need your number. My phone number is available on my profile for anyone I am friends with to access. Because they're my friends. If you don't like these people, or don't want them to have your number, _don't add them_. Problem solved. On a side note, the syncing feature sucks.
