> Here are the top five best-selling phones during Q2, via NPD’s Mobile Phone Track service:

>   * Apple iPhone 4
>   * Apple iPhone 3GS
>   * HTC EVO 4G
>   * HTC Inspire 4G
>   * Samsung INTENSITYII

Wow. Samsung, HTC, you're letting yourselves down. Nokia isn't even in this list. Remember the 3310 when Nokia was the king? Sort your shit out guys and build better phones with better UX. Or just keep copying Apple, your choice. Also, didn't the 3GS _get released in 2009_? That would make it over 2 years old. Just wow.
