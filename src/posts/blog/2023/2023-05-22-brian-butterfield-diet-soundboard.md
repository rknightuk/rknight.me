Over the weekend I spent some time splitting the audio from [the Brian Butterfield Diet sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NjTWvl8x-U) and then subsequently the [Christmas version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyk6sXHY9Vg). Both of these sketches are from [The Peter Serafinowicz Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peter_Serafinowicz_Show) from 2007.

I split the audio using [Sound Studio](https://www.felttip.com/ss/) which has a handy "split by markers" feature then used [Eleventy data files](https://www.11ty.dev) to output those files including some titles from a JSON files of all the audio. As much as I'd like to sit and sketch some terrible icons for each food item I went with [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) to save some time.
