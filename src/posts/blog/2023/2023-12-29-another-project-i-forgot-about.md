I totally forgot about one more project I'd like to get done this year. I want to take my current Eleventy-based site I used for [my](https://ruminatepodcast.com/) [podcasts](https://wegot.family/) and make it usable for anyone to quickly get a podcast up and running. I need to move any hard-coded stuff to a data file, plus decide how to handle file uploads and storage.

In the spirit of committing myself to this, I'm posting it here as an addendum to the [previous post](https://rknight.me/blog/welcome-to-the-knight-club/).
