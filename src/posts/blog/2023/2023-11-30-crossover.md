Sometimes one idea begets another. In the case of [Crossover](https://crossover.rknight.me) I had the idea while building [DoubleShift](/doubleshift) but I was too far in to change it. DoubleShift also now has some fun additional features like leaderboards which only make sense for that site.

Crossover, unlike DoubleShift, isn't limited to a handful of TV shows: if a show is in [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) you can compare it with Crossover.

There are a few pre-loaded shows on the site but you can search for any show - once you've found one, it gets added to the options so you can mix and match in any way you want.

The logo is a mix of Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones so you might think Game of Thrones would be a good default on the site but there are very few actors that crossover with other shows I was testing with. The font looked good though so here we are.
