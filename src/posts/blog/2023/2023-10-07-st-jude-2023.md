It's September 37th and the [Relay for St Jude campaign](https://512pixels.net/2023/10/775375-54/) has closed. They raised $774,262.53, putting Relay at $2.98m lifetime raised! Our St Jude sub-campaign raised $12,590.57 and sent out 106 sticker packs to 15 different countries. This is a far cry from [my initial goal of $250](https://rknight.me/st-jude-2023/).

I want to thank everyone who donated but I want to call out some people specifically as well:

- [Adam](https://neatnik.net) for donating half of [omg.lol's profits](https://omglol.news/2023/10/01/st-jude-fundraiser-report) for the entire month - [$3309](https://prami.paste.lol/2023-st-jude-fundraiser)! If you want to thank him, you should [sign up for omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb) - it's a fun community
- [Stephen](https://512pixels.net) for buying the [Coin Daddy domain](https://coinme.dad)
- [Kate](https://www.klmatthews.com) for always finding bugs the second I pushed a new change. Also for the idea for [Coin Me, Daddy](https://coinme.dad)
- [Ben](https://tildy.dev) for helping with the API so I could build all the stupid websites for the campaign (see below)
- [Ian](https://www.youtube.com/c/IanOfEarth), [Mike](http://gdovin.net) and all the other dollar daddies
- [Zach](https://zmknox.com) for creating the Donation Daddy logo

I also got myself a couple of nice rewards. [JD](http://jdburch.com) mowed my name into a lawn and I will be getting a Jony Cube sticker from [Matt](https://www.peerreviewed.io). We hit our first milestone which meant I had to watch [Superfast!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2933474/) - you can listen to the [episode of We Got Family about it here](https://wegot.family/5/).

The campaign this year led me to make four different websites to help with donations:

- [Septembed](https://septembed.rknight.me) - A script for embedding a campaign on your website. This was the start of the japes. Very proud of the name as well.
- [Desk Mat Help](https://deskmat.help) - The precursor to Coin Me, Daddy this site lists all the campaigns that were close to $250 to get a desk mat
- [Coin Me, Daddy](https://coinme.dad) - The most popular of the sites, this one was an idea from Kate. It shows all campaigns that have yet to raise one dollar to get a coin. There are _so many_ donations with the title "Dollar Daddy"
- [Donation Treats](https://donationtreats.rknight.me) - Lists all the rewards you can get for all the available campaigns

Initially, these were all separate websites with _very_ similar code. Towards the end of the month I merged these into one single codebase. This should make it a lot easier next year when I'm sure I'll think of some other site to do.
