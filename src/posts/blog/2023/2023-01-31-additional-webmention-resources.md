Some more links and tools I've found or had saved about webmentions. Read my post on [adding webmentions here](/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/).

### [@remy/webmention](https://github.com/remy/wm)

Sadly the webapp side of this is [down at the moment](https://remysharp.com/2023/01/30/on-vercel-if-some-of-my-sites-are-down) but the command line tool for _sending_ webmentions is completely standalone.

You can pass the script a url or an RSS feed and it will scan it to find links, confirm those sites accept web mentions, and send those mentions. I ran it once on my whole feed to send any mentions and then added it to my build steps to run it on the latest post:

```bash
npx webmention /path/to/feed.xml --limit 1 --send
```

> An eleventy plugin to fetch webmentions and helper methods to display them

Why didn't I look for a plugin when I was doing webmentions? No idea. This is going on my list to review and see if I can streamline my code a bit.
