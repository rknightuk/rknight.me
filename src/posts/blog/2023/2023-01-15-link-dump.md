- [A brief history of my newspaper blackout poems](https://austinkleon.com/2014/04/29/a-brief-history-of-my-newspaper-blackout-poems/). Not sure how I've not seen this before, but I'll be buying [the book ASAP](https://austinkleon.com/newspaperblackout/).
- [AI generated Marvel cat-characters](https://www.razzem.com/these-ai-generated-marvel-cat-characters-could-make-for-a-cute-animated-series/). Cute AF.
- [Sony Ericsson Xperia Pureness](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/sony-mobile/71544-sony-ericsson-xperia-pureness-review/). Not sure why this was in my read later list but very cool (article is from 2009)
- [Audio Cassette Player | We Are Rewind](https://www.wearerewind.com/). A cassette player with Bluetooth. It's like this product was made for me.
- [A portable clone of Wordle designed for the Nokia N-Gage](https://github.com/ngagesdk/wordle). Cool.
- [Written in Stone â€¢ A gallery of sidewalks, and the stamps and seals left by the people who laid them.](https://writteninstone.photo/) I already posted this but figured I'd pop it here too.
