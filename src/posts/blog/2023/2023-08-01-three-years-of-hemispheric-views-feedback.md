I recently started listening to the [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/) podcast and decided I would go back to the start and listen to the 74 previous episodes that I hadn't listened to. I wrote down _all_ my feedback. I started this endevour on the 17th of May and finished the last episode this morning. [Jason](https://grepjason.sh/) agreed to this:

> We will take any feedback, 3 years old or otherwise haha

In total I listened to just over 58 hours of main show and over ten hours of the one prime plus dot com member show. About ten episodes in I started singing the theme song to Baby Knight. 

### Main Show

- [Roast my desk please](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/desk-2023.jpg)
- 001 Jason tried Vegemite, has he tried marmite?

- 009 Of course the week starts on Monday, anything else is mayhem
- 009 I watched an episode of [Bargearse](https://youtu.be/Fahf77qzEnE) and it was glorious
- 010 I love picking a random movie that's on TV when I’m away in a hotel or something but never do it at home
- 010 One of favourite bands [covered the Round the Twist theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7bnFPaGnkc)
- 011 Andrew is a [briefcase wanker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsj2-dWf1ko)
- 012 Gabriel’s [Orange Lego X-Wing](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/poe-s-x-wing-fighter-75102) is canon
- 014 What the hell is with Australian nature
- 014 I would die for [the Gobbledok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vIaCXCkkrs)
- 014 “Nissan [Iambic pentameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iambic_pentameter)” 👏
- 016 Andrew hasn’t seen Batman and Robin?! He should rectify that
- 016 [I put a Raspberry Pi camera in an iSight](https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/)
- 017 "Double digit coffee action" would be a good band name 
- 019 My partner spent years using ~$10 headphones. When I gave her my good ones, she was blown away at how good music can sound
- 020 Screw it, I’m making my own asset deprecation spreadsheet 
- 020 Sealed triangle toastie is the best toastie type
- 022 Alex makes the media corner theme tune, a few years later he’s in Eurovision. Suspicious. 
- 022 The premise of [Crackerjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackerjack_(2002_film)) sounds identical to [Blackball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337879/)
- 022 “Perthsuaded” I hate this
- 023 “_There still isn’t a good email app on iOS_” - Andrew. This is because email is bad, stop looking for your own sanity
- 023 “Everything surrounding email is wrong”
- 023 [Here’s my homescreen](https://rknight.me/micro/110361312690891868/)
- 023 I wish Apple would allow apps to be anywhere on the Home Screen too. Please Tim Apple. 
- 023 I have 203 apps installed 
- 025 Is Andrew still using the johnny decimal system?
- 027 Game preservation is why I’ve tried as best I can to only buy physical games - currently I have around [300 across a bunch of consoles](https://rknight.me/collections/games)
- 028 A few years ago we built a [Nokia 3310 simulator](http://knockoffia.devsdodesign.com) in the browser
- 029 I wear shoes in the house, life is too short 
- 031 I wear the same black socks all year round, regardless of jeans or shorts. All my socks are identical so I don’t have to pair them up. I say no to funny socks
- 031 Perhaps there’s a market for discounted once-used socks, then Jason could have new socks every day 
- 031 This is more than I ever needed to know about air conditioning
- 033 I also love going to grocery stores in other countries 
- 033 I laughed at Andrew’s joke about going to Cloud 9
- 034 My neighbour works at the Office of National Statistics and it sounds fascinating

- 036 I spat my drink out at “FinderJimbo”
- 038 “Clean show”? Jason has definitely sworn on at least 4 episodes

- 038 TODAY! 
- 039 I know my neighbours now but didn’t at my last house that I lived at for 10 years. I did what Jason did when we moved and drew a map with names of everyone. It helped that we moved in around Christmas so everyone sent cards with their names
- 040 I am furious Andrew doesn’t use “Grand Canion” as a username everywhere because that is so fucking good
- 040 Pen licence! I never actually got mine because my writing was (and still is) terrible, I outlasted them until year 4 when everyone had to use a pen anyway
- 042 Right at the start Jason swears and isn’t bleeped and then immediately after in the same sentence he is bleeped. No notes, just amused
- 042 That stupid EA Sports intro in burned into my brain from play FIFA World Cup ‘98 on the N64. Immediately after Song 2 by Blur would play so it wasn’t all bad
- 044 Never say “state daddy” again
- 044 Fruit Loops is a garbage cereal. Lucky Charms all the way
- 044 Andrew said the milk on the box looked too white and creamy. That’s because they usually use paint or PVA glue for milk in food photography 
- 045 I couldn’t use just spotlight. I have so many [workflows](https://rknight.me/alfred-workflows/) I use in Alfred
- 046 The shuffling albums on Spotify drama with Adele was so stupid
- 046 One arcade machine for my house? Time Crisis 2
- 046 It’s 7am here and a breakfast lasagne sounds amazing 
- 046 What happened to [Decimeal](https://decimeal.com/)
- 049 “_I don’t know if anyone does this but go back to the beginning of the RSS archive, apparently people have other things to do_” - Martin
- 049 The formal intro thing is unsettling 
- 050 What on earth was all this Dolly Parton talk?!
- 051 I hadn’t considered the comparison to Dharma for Severance but that is an excellent observation 
- 051 🛎️ More Dolly Parton
- 051 I watched Severance in one night until 6am while sleep-deprived when Baby Knight was born. It definitely gave it a different vibe 
- 052 Another recommendation for Punk Rock Factory: [We Don't Talk About Bruno cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUbul4f8AX8)
- 053 The people saying sorry too much thing is a problem in the UK as well, I hate it 
- 054 I refuse to listen to podcasts that have dynamically inserted ads
- 054 I have a disappearing dock and like it. Sorry Natasha
- 055 My MX Master works fine on Bluetooth
- 057 Martin on Elon buying Twitter “_I’m cautiously optimistic that something really useful will happen and it will change for the better_”
- 058 My entrance music would be [Not the Same by Bodyjar](https://song.link/s/0q6Qyd2QaHMHp7APKyQsyi) because it’s a banger
- 059 I’m scared to do bad show notes lest I feel the wrath of Jason
- 061 I have my school yearbook but I never look at it 
- 061 Perfect foods: pizza, spaghetti bolognese, donor kebab with lettuce and garlic sauce

- 064 I refuse to believe it's pronounced ex-mouth
- 064 This business corner was incredible 
- 065 I guessed the bus story was fake
- 068 wtf was that Cappuccino talk 
- 069 We have Nobby’s nuts here too 
- 069 You’re making me want a Play Date
- 069 My top five movies:
	- Back to the Future (I even have a Back to the Future tattoo)
	- Hot Fuzz
	- Baby Driver
	- Captain America: Winter Soldier
	- Straight Outta Compton
- 070 Benji said he doesn’t like the yellow bit of eggs. Notable. 
- 070 “_Be more negative_” - Benji
- 072 Martin will hate this sign from a UK chain where [“everyday” should be two words](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-a-poundland-store-sign-71740740.html?imageid=1F597E32-BEC1-46FC-9C74-1CCCBC895D64&p=179593&pn=1&searchId=8798bbaa288a340a187eb179f2e6aaea&searchtype=0)
- 074 My favourite photos from 2022:

- 07 I started podcasting because I said, kind of as a joke, “Lets do a podcast?” to John Voorhees ~8 years ago

- 013 My mum was a social worker her entire career. I remember her saying “are you sure about these computers as a job?” when I was 16. Maybe she was right.
