I've been thinking about how better to handle all the different places I'm posting too including this site,  [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/rknightuk), and [my wiki](https://intersect.rknight.me/).  To quote [myself](https://toot.rknight.me/2023/01/07/starting-to-think.html):

> Starting to think some things I’ve put into my wiki might be better served as a blog post that I just update as and when I find things. The discoverability of pages is kinda crappy for anyone who isn’t me (because I know to go there to look for things)

For example, [this page about buying a house](https://intersect.rknight.me/buying-a-house/). Why isn't this a blog post? It _looks_ just like one, it's unlikely I'm going to buy another house so this is likely to be all I ever write about it. [This git page](https://intersect.rknight.me/cli/git/). There's no reason I couldn't have this as a blog post and just update it as I find other things. People are more likely to find it as a blog post than a page on my wiki.

Then there's the opposite: [this PiSight page](https://intersect.rknight.me/hardware/raspberry-pi/pisight/) is 100% links. I wonder if a link system with tags would be better than posting to a specific page each time I find a new link. Or I could add the links to [the PiSight blog post I wrote](https://rknight.me/building-a-pisight/).

The Intersect was fun to build but it's _complicated_. The build process takes a while, making any structural changes is a pain. Something simpler might be better. I should reduce it to the bare minimum of things that I need from it.

Should I incorporate the wiki into my personal site instead of having it on a different domain perhaps? Should I just do more blog posts when I find interesting things and not worry if it's "worth it" to post? Who knows.
