[From me, yesterday](https://social.lol/@robb/109988701670297916):

> We setup a baby name pool at work, £1 a guess. We have 50 names, £51 in the pot. Someone has guessed the name so no money for me. 

Some additional rules we discussed:

- If the correct answer is guessed by more than one person, the pot is split
- Spelling is not important. So "Emelia" and "Amelia" are the same name for the purposes of the Knightpool

I'm calling this the Knightpool because I can and definitely not [stealing the idea from Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/characters/deadpool-wade-wilson/in-comics). Here are the 50 names that have been guessed:
