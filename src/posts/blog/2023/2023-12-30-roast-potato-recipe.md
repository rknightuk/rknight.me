    >> notes: 2kg of potatoes is a reasonable amount for 4-6 people but we ate all those between three of us so do as many as you ~~want~~ can fit in your oven

    Peel the @Potatoes{2%kg} and chop them into four (or more if you have exceptionally large potatoes). Give them a rinse to remove some of the starch. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°c.

    Boil them in water with @Salt, @Crushed Garlic Cloves{6-10} (just smoosh these with the side of a knife), and a bit of @Rosemary and @Thyme for ~{15-20%minutes} until they just start become soft. Drain them and leave them to dry for about ~{10%minutes}.

    While the potatoes are draining, pop a generous amount of @goose fat{100%g} in a roasting tray, along with a drizzle of @Olive Oil{} if you're feeling fancy, and stick it in the oven to get the fat nice and hot.

    After the potatoes have dried out and the goose fat is hot, put all the potatoes in the roasting tray and make sure they all get a good covering with the fat, then into the oven with them. All told these should cook for around ~{90%minutes}. Every ~{30%minutes} take them out and turn them to make sure they're cooking evenly. For the last ~{20%minutes}, sprinkle some salt on them, and pop some garlic cloves, rosemary, and thyme into the tray. Serve them up and eat all the potatoes you can.

I tried this recipe on boxing day this year and it was fantastic so we made some more tonight which were, unsurprisingly, also fantastic. 

This recipe came from a Facebook reel which I'm not linking to for two reasons:

1. I had to OCR the steps out of the comments on the video so I worked hard for this
2. I can't find it anymore because searching for reels is impossible
3. Who puts a recipe in a video comment, come on
