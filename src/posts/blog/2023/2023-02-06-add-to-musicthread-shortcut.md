[MusicThread](https://musicthread.app/) is "_a website to create and share lists of music_" by [Ed Wellbrook](https://mastodon.social/@edwellbrook). I recently started using it to save [new tracks I've found](https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6IuBPKCCo7fsA8SFyXZLirH5W) and [new albums](https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6LZz60026Onq3waGuwt7WdJ5x), which are then cross-posted to [my Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@robb) with [Echo](https://echo.rknight.me).

The iOS app, currently in beta, has a share sheet extension for adding to a thread, but for MacOS I needed to make something in Shortcuts. The shortcut I've made (after a lot of ranting about how bad shortcuts is) can either ask for a music link to add, or be used directly from Apple Music under the share menu. It then asks which thread to add the link to.
