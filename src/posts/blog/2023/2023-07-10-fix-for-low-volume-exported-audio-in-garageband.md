Yesterday [Mike pointed out](https://hachyderm.io/@mikestreety/110685303152811714) that the pilot episode of [my new podcast](https://wegot.family/0) was quiet compared to other shows. I opened up the project files in GarageBand and couldn't see anything that would be causing this so I started hunting around in the settings. It turns out the "Export projects at full volume" was causing this. I don't know what this setting is supposed to do but I turned it off, exported the episode again, and it was fixed.
