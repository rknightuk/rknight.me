I've spent an ungodly amount of time this week thinking about <s>the Roman Empire</s> how IRC could work for small communities - clients, servers, setup, maintenance. [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat) is the best client in my opinion but it doesn't support all the new features of IRC like reactions and avatars. It's close to perfect though. I already [posted about this](https://rknight.me/notes/202602091558/) but it's worth putting here too: two posts about setting up an IRC server like it's 2006; one from Melanie using [Treafik and Coolify](https://melkat.blog/p/hosting-an-irc-server-with-traefik-and-coolify/) and one from Adam which is a [pretty in-depth starter guide](https://www.neatnik.net/setting-up-an-irc-server/).

Jim has [a really smart way of adding edit links](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/os-as-cms/) to his site that open in native apps.

[Mondegreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen) "_is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase in a way that gives it a new meaning_". The etymology is so good - "mondegreen" is a misheard word from a 1765 book. (via [Friendship Material](https://friendship-material.simplecast.com/episodes/eight-degrees-less-hot-Zgq1Zjoj))

I learned about [Aviation English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_English) which is "_the de facto international language of civil aviation_". Native English are worse at it in emergency situations because they tend to deviate from the standard. Fun stuff.

Cory was seeing the same as me in his analytics - lots of automated traffic from China. He came up [with a blunt way to deal with it](https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2026/blocking-entire-countries-because-of-scrapers). [Matthias is seeing similar issues](https://matthiasott.com/articles/webspace-invaders). I don't knonw how the we get out of this shit.

I don't have a use for it right now, but [Datasette](https://datasette.io) looks very interesting.

[This post by Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/) is a great explainer of what can, in theory, be good about AT Protocol, the protocol that powers Bluesky.

[Handy](https://handy.computer) is a "_free and open source app for speech to text_". Nice.

I'm not in the market for a new Git system but if I was then [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz) would be on my list.

[Purveyors of Packaging](https://purveyorsofpackaging.com/?ref=simplebits.com) is a goldmine of old packaging design. [via [SimpleBits](https://simplebits.com)]

[Font Tools](https://font-tools.com) is a collection of, well, font tools. Handy.

This [PS2 recompilation project](https://redgamingtech.com/playstation-2-recompilation-project-is-absolutely-incredible/) has me very excited.

I learned about [Poste Restante](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/mail/poste-restante) "_a service designed for travellers who don’t have a permanent address_". Send stuff to any post office and mark it as "poste restante" and the recipient can pick it up. Seems to be available [all over the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poste_restante).

This [list of suffixes for street names](https://www.snn.geoplace.co.uk/list-of-suffixes-for-street-names) has some great ones I've never heard of - "Twitten" anyone?

[This post about search engines with their own indexes](https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/) has a lot of great info in it.
