The kids are both in nursery now and I'm back at work after two weeks off at Christmas. 

The [sticker sales](https://rknight.me/shop) are going well, I've just about broken even if you do some flexible maths and I have a new pack incoming in the next few weeks.

After this post, my Raindrop queue is down to just eight links. Enjoy.

### Links

[ISBNDB](https://isbndb.com) looks like an amazing API for books - it's paid, so not ideal for hobby projects but could come in handy for bigger projects.

[Cinemapper](https://cinemapper.com) shows filming locations for movies on a map which is always fun.

I think we all hate printers with a fiery passion but this [open printer](https://www.crowdsupply.com/open-tools/open-printer) has piqued my interest.

[Yamatter](https://danburzo.ro/projects/yamatter/) is "_a command-line tool to inspect and transform YAML front-matter data_". I've done stuff like this with custom scripts in the past, this would have saved me a lot of time.

[enclose.hgorse](https://enclose.horse) is another day game I enjoy but definitely can't trust myself to play every day.

James [used microformats and granary](https://jamesg.blog/2026/01/03/turn-a-list-into-a-web-feed) to turn his HTML element of day list into a web feed and RSS feed.

Keeping this [Apple Photos exporter](https://github.com/rcarmo/PhotosExport)  bookmarked for if I ever try to nuke my Apple Photos usage.

Turns out those `pkpass` ticket files you sometimes get to add to Apple/Google wallet can be converted to PNGs [relatively easily](https://gist.manganiello.tech/fabio/pkpass2png).

[Brad has a great post](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2026/1/4/i-love-cleaning-fountain-pens) on the tools and techniques he uses to clean fountain pens.

[Hot Dang Press](https://hotdangpress.com) make very cool iron-on art.

[Get out of my \<head\>](https://getoutofmyhead.dev) is an incredibly handy reference for what should be inside your `head` to show previews, favicons, and other related things. I added a link to this on [Lens](https://lens.rknight.me).

I think I found the only UK-based company that makes pen cases, storages, displays, and trays - [Turner's Workshop](https://www.theturnersworkshop.co.uk).

[Opus No. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7xn5zeJ4D4) is that fucking song everyone has on their hold music.

Speaking of music [I Want my MTV Rewind](https://wantmymtv.vercel.app) is amazing.

These two [Struthless](https://www.youtube.com/@struthless) videos are really worth your time: 

- [A chaotic guide to making stuff instead of doomscrolling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n8W6CBxc64)
- [26 hits of brilliant flawed HUMAN creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdErKRSBnag)

I've had [this article from Jason](https://jasonsantamaria.com/blog/large-language-muddle) saved for a while and I haven't stopped thinking about this line:

> I want to make things because I’m human and alive.

I sketched it too because why not.

### Outtakes

Outtakes is a new section for failed or disregarded ideas, inspired by [anh](https://anhvn.com/posts/2025/outtakes-etc/#incomplete-projects-that-i-posted-about-that-are-more-or-less-abandoned-in-their-current-state).

I had a note for a while that said "Scroll all the colours". I had a look around and there wasn't anything that did this but once I started thinking about it I realised how boring it would be. I did stumble upon [all RGB](https://allrgb.com) though: "_The objective of allRGB is simple: To create images with one pixel for every RGB color (16,777,216); not one color missing, and not one color twice._". Cool. 

This also had it's own sub-failure of sorts - I started writing out my ideas on index cards, [à la Paloma](https://palomakop.tv/notes/arena-cards/##), and it _was_ helpful to focus on a single idea (like the one above) but I also have ideas in my journal, Obsidian, Notes, my brain, probably other places. A failure yes, but it showed me I need to sort my shit out and work out a single place to put all these. 

![An index card on a green cutting board. The card says "Scroll All Colors" at the top then some bullet points about how to implement such a thing](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2026/scroll-all-colors-project-card.jpg)

Until next time, be excellent to each other.
