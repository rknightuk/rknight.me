Usually if I find an 88x31 button related thing I'd bookmark it and pop it in [my weeknotes](http://rknight.me/blog/tags/weeknotes) but over the past few days, a smorgasbord of related links have come to my attention so, to paraphrase Morbius, it's bloggin' time.

The first is a new directory of buttons I'd not seen before by [Neonaut](https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31) who also links other directories at the bottom which I've added to my [list on LinkAce](https://links.rknight.me/guest/lists/1). So many buttons.

Yesterday in the [32 Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe) Discord, Dan posted a new project they'd completed: an [88x31 button creator](https://ritual.sh/resources/button-generator/). It has more options than I knew what to do with but I did make this banger of a button:

![A blue button that says rknight.me. The text is waving around and changing colours](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2026/animated-rknight.me-button.gif)

As if that wasn't enough, I came across this post about [making the Game Boy color boot animation into a an 88×31 button](https://zakhary.dev/blog/gbc-web-button). Lots of interesting technical stuff going on here to make this happen.

Finally, as I [posted yesterday](https://rknight.me/notes/202601082009/), [Chris Burnell](https://chrisburnell.com) made some new [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) buttons which I love.
