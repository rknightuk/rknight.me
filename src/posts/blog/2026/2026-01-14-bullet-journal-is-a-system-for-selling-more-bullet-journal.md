excerpt: "The people behind Bullet Journal spent the last 12 months making the website impossible to use for everyone who might want to learn about bullet journalling and better for everyone who wants to spend $1000 on a course"

When I [bit the bullet](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) early last year, my first stop was the [Bullet Journal website](https://bulletjournal.com). What I found there was everything one might need to get started: introduction videos, easy to follow tutorials, blog posts, community content, it was glorious. There was also the store, as there is today, and courses, but I'm not against people making money.

12 months later and it's as if a completely separate entity runs the website having only been given a vague description of what it was before. I would go to the site to find a guide on a specific concept I'd previously seen and those pages were either impossible to find just by navigating or when I did find them via Google search they would 404. Not found. Get fucked. Pay us for a course instead.

Ignoring the fact that the website is hilariously broken in Safari and has been for months, as far as I can tell what's happened is this: Bullet Journal spent a decade relying on the community to come up with ideas, resources, write blog posts for them, and generally make BuJo the success it is but now they've decided that it's not enough to sell notebooks and pens. Now they're in the courses business: there's three of the fuckers called "plans". One of them will help you "become the author your life" which I assume is supposed to be "author OF your life" but no one is checking anything. 

To quote Ryder, the founder of Bullet Journal:

> in September of 2014 I launched a Kickstarter to raise the funds to build a new website to curate the best of what the community was sharing

The website is _nothing_ like this now. There is no links to community content or the intro guides I read last year. It's explicitly mentioned on [this page](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/story) that 2025 was the year for new "plans" to be launched but no mention of nuking everything else that quite frankly they didn't work on, everyone else in the community did. [This free reference guide](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/bullet-journal-reference-guide) from Tiny Ray of Sunshine, as an example, was added to the official guides. Wow that's cool except where is that page now? Gone. No soup for you.

Oh and the the images that go along with these plans? AI generated slop because of course it is. Hundreds of dollars of courses but they can't pay an artist to draw a bloke in a hamster wheel, that would be impossible. Gotta fire up the slop machine for that. If they're using slop machines for illustrations there's no way I can trust that the courses are any better. The "author your life" plan is $1000 in case you were wondering.

![A man walking in a treadmill. It's generated by AI so it looks shit.](https://cdn.rknight.me/site/2026/bullet-journal-man-on-treadmill-ai-slop.jpg)

I'm not angry about them adding "plans", courses, whatever else they want. Businesses gunna business. It's just yet another thing that was a nice thing that now isn't any more. It's just another system that exists only to either sell the system, learn about that system, or learning how to teach that system to other people at costs that are clearly designed to get employers to pay for them. A person who's curious about Bullet Journaling will hit the site, see it's not for them, and leave.

What I find most frustrating about this is that it _has_ become a useful tool for me (I'm on my third notebook) but I can't reasonably send anyone to the site to learn about it any more. At this point, if you _do_ want to find out more about bullet journalling, or journalling in general, you'd be much better served by [Matt Ragland](https://www.youtube.com/c/mattragland) or [Jashii Corrin](https://www.youtube.com/jashiicorrin). I _could_ recommend [the book](https://rknight.me/almanac/books/2025-01-20-the-bullet-journal-method/) but if they can't be bothered to pay people for their art, then you shouldn't give them money either.
