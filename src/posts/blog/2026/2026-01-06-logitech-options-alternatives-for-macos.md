As of this moment [Logitech Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/software/logi-options-plus.html), the app that handles all the features for my Logitech MX Master mouse, is down. It connects to Logitech's server for some stupid reason but if said server is down then my mouse doesn't work properly. Very cool and normal. 

[I posted about this](https://rknight.me/notes/202601062305/) and [Reilly](https://rknight.me/notes/202601062305/) was all over it suggesting [LinearMouse](https://linearmouse.app/). I downloaded it and it's an almost-exact replacement for the Logitech crap with the exception of gestures. In Options+ I could set <kbd>thumb button</kbd> + <kbd>swipe</kbd> to switch between spaces (or in my case, my single full screen app - the Music app). As a workaround, I set LinearMouse to use <kbd>⌘</kbd> + the back/forward button to do the same thing.

The Logitech software has always been shit but I could live with it but not being able to use my mouse because servers are down? Fuck right off. 

Anyway, I _had_ started collecting alternatives while I was putting Baby Knight II to bed but given LinearMouse does everything I need, I won't be trying them but here they are:

- Logitech have an [offline-only version for IT admins to use](https://prosupport.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/10991109278871-Logitech-Options-Offline-Installer).
- [BetterMouse](https://better-mouse.com/) - this one looks like it has _all_ the options.
- [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/)
- [Mac Mouse Fix](https://macmousefix.com/en/)
