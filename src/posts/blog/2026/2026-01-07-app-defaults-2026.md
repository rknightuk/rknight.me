It's been a couple of years since my [first post in this series](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults/). [In 2024 I did](https://rknight.me/blog/app-defaults-2024/) an "updates only" list but I think it's worth going for a full list again this time.

- 📨 Mail Client: Apple Mail still. Email sucks, I don't need it to be better I need it to go away.
- 📮 Mail Server: iCloud with custom domain. 
- 📝 Notes: Obsidian. I've just done a big reset of all my notes and I'm following [Steph Ango's](https://stephango.com/vault) structure somewhat.
- ✅ To-Do: Journal for untimed things, Reminders for timed.
- 📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: Camera.app
- 🟦 Photo Management: Photos.app
- 📆 Calendar: Fantastical
- 📁 Cloud File Storage: iCloud Drive
- 📖 RSS: [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) with [Reeder Classic](https://reederapp.com/classic/)
- 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: Contacts.app
- 🌐 Browser: Safari
- 💬 Chat: Discord, Signal, IRC
- 🔖 Bookmarks: [LinkAce](https://www.linkace.org)
- 📑 Read It Later: [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io)
- 📜 Word Processing: what
- 📈 Spreadsheets: Numbers
- 📊 Presentations: Keynote if I have to but I never do
- 🛒 Shopping Lists: Alexa lists, reminders
- 🍴 Meal Planning: Journal
- 💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: Numbers
- 📰 News: Nope
- 🎵 Music: Apple Music scrobbled to Last.fm with [Sleeve](https://replay.software/sleeve)
- 🎤 Podcasts: Overcast
- 🔐 Password Management: 1Password, begrudgingly.

When this post is added, that will be _five hundred_ blog posts on the [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me) website. You should go and listen to the episode that started it all, [097: Duel of the Defaults](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097).
