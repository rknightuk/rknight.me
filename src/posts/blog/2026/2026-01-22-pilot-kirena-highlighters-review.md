Last week I bought two sets of Pilot Kire-na highlighters: [the basic set](https://www.afth.co.uk/pilot---kire-na-highlighter---basic-set-66578-p.asp) and [the pale set](https://www.afth.co.uk/pilot---kire-na-highlighter---pale-set-66581-p.asp) because I bloody love highlighters and they [won the Japanese stationery awards last year](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/The-Best-of-Japan-s-Stationery-Awards-2025/pt/1040) so I figured they must be pretty good. I bought these from [Art from the Heart](https://www.afth.co.uk) who are, as best I can tell, the only UK stockist right now. They were £7.99 per pack, around the same as I've paid before for other similar pens.

These are double-ended with one end having a fine tip for writing, circling, etc and the other, the highlighter end, having a plastic guide around the chisel edge of the highlighter.

The basic set are bright colours and _much_ brighter than anything Zebra make with Mildliners. For my taste though, the pale set are the nicest. Amazingly, Pilot has managed to find some shades Zebra haven't done in the [41 existing Mildliners](https://mildliners.rknight.me). It's always fun to add some more colours to the collection. Here's the pale set next to the closest Mildliner equivalents.

The plastic guide definitely makes these fall firmly into the "use for proper highlighting" category for me rather than decorating and drawing but that's not a bad thing. There's a nice bit of flex in them as well which helps with getting them in just the right place. I found highlighting with the guide a lot easier to get decent coverage of my writing compared to winging it with other highlighters.

The fine tip on the other end of these pens is lovely; it's thin enough to write with but thick enough to make circling something notable obvious on the page. This is where the bright colours come out on top.

I don't know where these fit into my life because I don't do a lot of "proper" highlighting but the colours are so good that I'm going to find somewhere to use them.
