I've had this idea in my list for a long time - generate random can colours and name for Monster because why not. I finally got it done this week and it's live at [monster.rknight.me](https://monster.rknight.me).

I made an SVG of a standard Monster can, then the inputs set the colours on the SVG. You can share your creations using the share button, which gives you a URL that looks like this:

```
https://monster.rknight.me/?can=a81fd7&label=4e4824&name=virgin+moleskin
```

That is a link to a purple and brown monster named "Virgin Moleskin". So yeah, this is a thing that exists.
