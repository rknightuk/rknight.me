My last now update was [November](https://rknight.me/blog/now-november-2025/) and I was hunting for a pink ink. I [found it](https://rknight.me/blog/hunting-for-the-hottest-pink-ink/) and I've been using it constantly since then.

I have a new sticker pack, _The Internet Pack_, which you can [buy here](https://rknight.me/shop).

I am deeply disliking my website design and I've tried a million different new things but I can't get anything new I like so I'm keeping it for now. 

This did lead me to start making a sort of starter kit based on [the snippet from my toolkit](https://rknight.me/intersect/web/toolkit/) and [uchū](https://uchu.style). I want to _not_ spend time fiddling with fonts and colours and such for every little project.

I'm halfway through [Everything but the Code](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/everything-but-the-code) and it's been really useful even if it's not exactly targeted for me. I'm currently dumping every idea for a project with every possible feature onto paper so I can whittle it down to the best ideas.

Also I'm angry, in no particular order, about nazis, AI, ICE, Tim Cook, age verification, probably other stuff. None of this is normal.
