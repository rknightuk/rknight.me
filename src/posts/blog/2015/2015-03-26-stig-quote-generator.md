This morning, I was watching Top Gear and decided it would be fun to create the [Stig quote generator](http://code.robblewis.me/stig-quotes/). I grabbed all the "some say" quotes from the [Top Gear Wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Top_Gear) page and split them into two parts (the "some say" part and the "and that" parts). The generator then grabs two of them at random, one of each type, and joins them together. Example:

> Some say that his heart is in upside down, and that if he felt like it he could fire Alan Sugar.


The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/rknightuk/stig-quotes) if that's your thing.
