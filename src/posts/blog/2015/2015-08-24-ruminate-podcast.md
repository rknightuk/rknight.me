[John Voorhees](https://johnvoorhees.co/) and I decided to have a go at creating out own podcast. The current description of the show is:

> A podcast about the opportunities and challenges that technology presents us with every day

This might change in the future (podcasts are harder than they seem) but for now we'll be talking about how technology helps solve problems, as well as some non-tech related topics like terrible food, and why you would save a pair of shoes for 10 years.

~You can subscribe and listen to the first episode at [http://ruminatepodcast.com/1](http://ruminatepodcast.com/1) and follow us ~~on Twitter~~ on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@ruminate).
