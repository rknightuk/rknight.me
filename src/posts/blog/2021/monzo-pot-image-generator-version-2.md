It's been a while since I [released the first version](https://rknight.me/monzo-pot-image-generator/) of the [Monzo pot image generator](https://potimages.rknight.me/) and there's been a [lot of requests](https://community.monzo.com/t/monzo-pot-image-generator/102120) on the Monzo forum for various new features.

So I spent some time adding and updating the site:

- New about modal with credits for the new icons:
    - Nearly 2000 brand logos from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
    - Country flags from [lipis/flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css)
    - Country icons from [djaiss/mapsicon](https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon)
    - Full set of emoji from [Openmoji](https://openmoji.org/library/)
- Premium backgrounds from [Ben in the forums](https://community.monzo.com/t/monzo-pot-image-generator/102120/178)
- Upload your own background image
- New coloured Monzo logo from the Monzo press kit
- Offline support
