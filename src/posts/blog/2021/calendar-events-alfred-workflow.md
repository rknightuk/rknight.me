tl;dr: Calendar events workflow for Alfred. [Download it here](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/calendar-events).

I released a [Reminders workflow](https://rknight.me/reminders-alfred-workflow/) a few days ago and while working on that I realised a lot of the code would be reusable for a version to manage calendar events. So I went at it tonight while it was too hot to sleep (it's 3am).

Like the reminders one, it uses an only-for-this-use-case CLI tool which you [can view on Github here](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-calendars-helper). 

One difference with this one is opening and creating events. I wanted the workflow to stand on it's own but I use Fantastical as my calender so it has two modes: one for default Calendar.app and one for Fantastical. By changing the `usefantastical` workflow variable events will be opened and created in Fantastical. This is the recommended way of using it. 

With this workflow you can:

- View upcoming events for the next 5 days (all or a specific calendar)
- Open events in Calendar.app or Fantastical
- Set a default calendar for creating events
