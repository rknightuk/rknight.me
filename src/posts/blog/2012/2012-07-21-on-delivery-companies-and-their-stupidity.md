I was going to write about delivery companies after [Myke Hurley explained](http://www.70decibels.com/bionic/2012/7/19/003-ready-for-prime-time.html) the nonsense he was spewed while waiting for his Nexus 7 delivered, but I hadnâ€™t had any recent experience with delivery companies. And then today, a neighbour who I never speak to knocked on my door with a parcel I had no idea had been given to her. Four days ago. The delivery company in question is [Hermes](http://www.hermes-europe.co.uk/). They had delivered my parcel to my neighbour four days ago without posting anything to let me know when my parcel was. Well done. What is it about delivery companies that makes them just not give a crop? Do they not care what the public view of them is? These are not isolated incidents. This happens to all of us regularly, almost every delivery I get there is a problem. The best company I get signed-for deliveries from? Royal Mail. Signed-for delivery is not even their primary business. So frustrating. Rant over.
