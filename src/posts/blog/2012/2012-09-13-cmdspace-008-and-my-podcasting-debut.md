Yesterday, I was lucky enough to be on [CMD+Space 008](https://www.relay.fm/cmdspace/8) hosted by Myke Hurley. I was alongside Stephen Hackett, Dave Caolo, Shawn Blanc, Florian Taltavull and Blake Hill. I got a little bit overexcited when I answered, so look out for my slightly manic "Hello!". I had an awesome time on the show and am seriously looking into starting my own podcast. I loved it. Also, Stephen and Myke are wrong about the new Nano.
