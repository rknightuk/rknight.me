I own a printer. A HP Photosmart something-or-other. Most of the time, I use it because it's there. I could make do without out it but it's there. It cost me £20 from a company I used to work for and I've only replaced the ink once. But once this ink runs out I was considering never using it again. And then I see [this on the HP Ink Cartidges blog:](http://www.hpinkcartridges.co.uk/technology-blog/2012-05-hp-introduces-nano-sponge)

> …I then took another HP 350, the same cartridge but this time the manufacturers date was 2012 on the cartridge, I removed the top in the same way as before and to be totally honest I could not believe what I was looking at, the hydrophobic sponge inside the 2012 cartridge is only half the size!!

I definitely won't be buying any more ink. Half the size? Stingy bastards. via [Macgasm](http://www.macgasm.net/2012-05-09/this-is-why-i-dont-own-a-printer/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+macgasm%2Fmain+%28Macgasm%29).
