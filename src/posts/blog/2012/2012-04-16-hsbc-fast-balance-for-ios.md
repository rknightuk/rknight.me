HSBC have finally released a current account app for iOS. HSBC Fast Balance does exactly what it says on the tin: allows you to quickly check your balance and your five most recent transactions. Other features include topping up your mobile phone credit and multiple account support.

The main reason this app excites me somewhat is the ability to check my balance without using the horrific [secure key](http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/customer-support/online-banking-security/secure-key) which makes logging in so much more difficult than it needs to be. The app simply asks for a 5–8 digit passcode for logging in and you can see your balance straight away. There is no ability to make payments or edit direct debits/standing orders from the app, and judging by HSBC’s track record, this won’t be happening anytime soon. But at least I can check my balance on the go easily now. HSBC Fast Balance is [free in the app store](http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/popups/app-store).
