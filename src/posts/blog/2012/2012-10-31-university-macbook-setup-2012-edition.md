If you’ve been reading my blog for a while, you may have seen my [MacBook Pro Setup post](/blog/my-macbook-pro-setup-for-university/) from last year. Within that article, I listed the applications I was using for university on my MacBook Pro. Not a huge amount has changed in the last year, but I’m now running an 11” Air and have removed a lot of the apps from last year and added a few. 

### Replaced and removed

Cog is gone. I just don’t find the need to play music on my Air whilst at uni, so it’s gone. Writeroom is also MIA. I now use a combination of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for coding and [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) and [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) for any other writing. NVAlt has been replaced with a project in Sublime Text, although I am considering switching back for note editing. The biggest change has been switching away from Coda 2, which I was using until a few weeks ago, when I switched to Sublime Text. I’m starting to find it almost too feature-rich for my needs, although I do jump back into it every now and again. Skitch has also been replaced with [Droplr](https://droplr.com/hello), although I sometimes install Skitch just for image annotation.

### Hanging in there

Apps that are still hanging around from last year include 1Password, Alfred, Forklift, TextExpander, Caffiene and Dropbox (obviously). 

### Change for the better

Last year when I wrote my post I felt like I had a perfect system. Obvisouly, this is not the case. At this moment, I feel the same way. But who knows what apps will be released that will make their way into my workflow?
