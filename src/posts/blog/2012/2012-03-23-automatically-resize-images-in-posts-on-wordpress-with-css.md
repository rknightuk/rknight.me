Quick tip for something that I just worked out on how to automatically resize a large image to the maximum width of your Wordpress post section: 

```css
.post img {
	max-width: 100%;
	height: auto;
}
```

Simply change the `.post` class to the name of your post class/ID and any images larger than the size of your post section will automatically resize.
