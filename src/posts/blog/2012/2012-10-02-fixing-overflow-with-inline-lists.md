Whilst creating a new site yesterday and working with inline lists, this code resulted in the menu items overlapping. 

```css    
nav li	{
    list-style-type: none;
    display: inline;
    padding: 5px 20px 5px 20px;
    background: #FFAEF9;
}
```
    

After messing around with pretty much everything I worked out the solution is as simple as setting a margin for the list items and setting display to inline-block: 
    
```css
nav li  {
    list-style-type: none;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 3px 0;
    padding: 5px 20px 5px 20px;
    background: #FFAEF9;
}
```

And this fixes the overflow issues of overlapping. Hopefully this will come in useful to at least one other person.
