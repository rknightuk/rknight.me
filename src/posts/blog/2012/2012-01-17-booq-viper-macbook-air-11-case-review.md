I recently got a MacBook Air and the first thing I always look for once I get a new gadget is protection. Due to the size and weight of the Air I didn't want anything to bulky or heavy, but still something that would protect it from knocks and scrapes whilst being dragged around from lecture to lecture at Uni. With most of my gadgets, I tend to sway towards slip case as they are easy to access your gear. But honestly, most slip cases look awful with no decreeable style at all. After a lot of searching around, sifting through Amazon reviews and asking a few people on Twitter, I decided on the [Booq Viper](http://www.booqbags.com/Viper-11-macbook-air-case). 

### Overview

#### Pros

  * Solid feel so I don't worry about knocks
  * Excellent build quality
  * Light
  * Extra pockets for kindle, cables and other stuff
#### Cons

  * Awkard positioning of the MacBook Air slot
  * Not big enough for power cable, although this isn't a deal breaker, may not be the case with US/European plugs
  * There is no handle, which some people might want

### Price

I picked up the Viper for [just under £40 on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Booq-Viper-Hard-Case-MacBook/dp/B004C3480E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326806901&sr=8-1) but the price varies wildly depending on where you look. Many of the reviews I read mentioned how "expensive" this case is. Expensive? For your £850+ MacBook? You get what you pay for. 

### Quality

The Viper is build from quality materials. A semi-solid outer shell protects from knocks and the neoprene lining protects the Air from scratches. The inside lip as well as the placement of the MacBook slot is designed in such a way to stop the zip from ever touching or causing damage to your Air. 

### Design

Although my photos may not entirely do it justice, the Viper is a beautiful case. Every part of the case is well thought out and serves a purpose. My only gripe is with the placement of the slot for the MacBook Air. Unlike most other cases, the Viper's slot is located with the opening closest to the fold in the case. This can, and does, make removing your laptop difficult at times. This is obviously done to stop any friction between the MacBook and the zip and only adds a second or two to the removal process. ((I have found that by putting the Air in hinge-first, it is much easier to remove. If this sounds like it will be an issue for you, then I would recommend perhaps looking at different case.)) The Viper feels light and even with additional cables and my Kindle, still feels (and probably is), lighter than my MacBook Pro did. ((I haven't actually weighed the difference, I don't own any type of scales.))

### Storage

As I said at the beginning, I generally sway towards slip cases which offer only storage for the intended gadget. With the Viper, there are three additional storage pockets. The first is a pocket that spans the entire inside of the case, approximately the same dimensions as an A4 piece of paper. And of course, based on the size you can fit a few A4 documents in said pocket. However, I tried to fit a lined A4 notebook in and it's just a little bit too small. The other two pockets are next to each other, half the size of the first. I keep my [Griffin Mini USB Cables](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Griffin-GC17097-Cable-Micro-Apple/dp/B003T5KXJQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326808505&sr=8-1) and a couple of memory sticks in one side and in the other my other new favourite gadget: my Kindle 4. As it turns out, the pocket is a perfect fit for my kindle, alleviating the need to use my horrible Kindle slip case. ((Despite being "designed for Kindle 4", the neoprene slip case I purchased is about an inch longer than it should be.)) 

### Conclusion

The Booq Viper is the nicest case I have ever owned. The build quality is excellent, it looks great and the extra storage after years of using slip cases is very welcome. I can just chuck it in my bag and forget about it. The only issue I have with it, as I mentioned above, is the position of the MacBook slot being somewhat difficult to access at times. But for me this is a spectacular case and the extra seconds it takes to get the Air out is far outweighed by the overall quality of the case.
