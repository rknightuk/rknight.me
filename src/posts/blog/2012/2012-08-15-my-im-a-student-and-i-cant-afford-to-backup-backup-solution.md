With all this talk of losing data (see [here](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012-08-mat-honan-video/) and [here](http://bettermess.com/100/)), I thought I should share my I’m-a-student-don’t-judge-me-I-backup-on-the-cheap backup solution. You might be thinking “What’s with the title, Robb?”. I have heard many of my uni friends make this claim when I enquire as to the workings of their backup. It’s simply not true.

Before I start, I should make it clear that if I lost everything, the only things I would miss are photos, [personal videos](http://vimeo.com/rmlewisuk) and my university work. Everything else is replaceable. 

### Onsite

My onsite backup consists of two solutions, one automatic and one manual. I have Time Machine setup to automatically backup every night to a Western Digital 2tb drive that cost around £80 on Amazon. In fact, it’s [this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Western-Digital-Elements-External-Desktop/dp/B003IPC21Y/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=JFKPMMF8MGGW&coliid=IR90M3W7NKPQH). This covers me for everything that is on my iMac and should the hard drive fail, this is my fallback. If you’re on Windows, find something similar to make sure you’re backed up. (I haven’t used Windows for so long, I don’t know what is currently the best solution).

The manual solution is due to how devestated I would be if I lost my photos. Every week, I manually transfer new photos to another external hard drive (160gb this time) and put that in my fireproof safe. This is totally unnessacary, as you’ll see when you read on, but keeps me sane about losing photos.

### Cloud

For cloud backup, I use [Dropbox](http://db.tt/y4aAIZ9). I have the 100gb plan which costs me all of $9.99/£6.70 a month. Every document, text file, photo and video I have is in Dropbox, all of which is synced to my MacBook Air.

As a secondary measure, I have a free Google Drive account which syncs one folder and one folder only: my university work. This means my uni work is backed up to both Dropbox and GDrive. Going into my second year next month, I really can’t afford to lose any coursework or notes.

The total inital cost of this setup was around £100 for both the external drives, although most of us probably have a drive sat around with plenty of spare space for a backup that could save you from losing the files that matter to you. As for paying for Dropbox, it’s a few quid a month. ([SkyDrive](skydrive.live.com/) and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/start#home) are also viable options for cloud storage). I have luckily never had a hard drive fail, or had an account hacked, but if I did, at least I’d know I was backed up.
