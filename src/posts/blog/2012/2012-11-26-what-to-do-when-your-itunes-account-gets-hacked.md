Early Saturday morning, 2am to be exact, I recieved an email from Apple confirming my lastest purchase. Nothing unusual, I buy apps all the time. Didn’t bother checking it, just marked it as read and archived it. Then I started thinking about what I had bought that day from the iTunes store. I couldn’t think of anything, so I checked the email: £149.99 for an in-app purchase of NBA Season Pass. “Shit” was my first reaction. My account had been comprimised. 

As someone with a keen interested in technology and specifically Apple, I’ve read about this stuff countless times and yet I had no idea what to do. So I had to wing it. First thing was fairly obvious: change my password. If your account gets comprimised, this is the first thing you need to do. To do this go to <http://iforgot.apple.com> and reset your password. 

Once I had done that, I had no idea how to go about getting Apple to stop/refund the charge. I Googled around and came across [this contact page](http://www.apple.com/support/contact/) on Apple’s site. I went through the various options and eventually got to a point where I could request a support call. No sooner had I selected for Apple to call me, than my phone rang. 

Trying to sound reasonably calm, I explained to the lady on the phone that the purchase was not me and I needed a refund. She very clearly told me what she was doing at all times, confirmed with me that I had changed my password and told me I would get a refund within 24 hours.

At this point (around 3am) I went to sleep. When I woke up I had an email from both Apple, and Click and Buy, confirming that the refund had been sucessfully processed. And breath. To clarify, for anyone who is reading this because their account has been comprimised:

  1. Change you password immediately <http://iforgot.apple.com>
  2. Request a support call from <http://www.apple.com/support/contact/>
  3. Relax

The most annoying part about the whole thing? Because I’m in the UK, I couldn’t have purchased the season pass even if I wanted to, as it’s US only. It was a scary moment that I hope not to have to repeat. However, Apple’s fast response time and the helpfulness of the representative who I spoke to on the phone are exactly the reason why I buy into Apple’s ecosystem.
