[70Decibels is merging with 5by5](http://www.70decibels.com/blog/2013/3/13/were-moving-to-5by5.html) which is great news for everyone involved, including listeners. Myke has worked incredibly hard to get 70Decibels to where it is today, starting with The Bro Show and expanding to the packed list of shows now:

>70Decibels is nearly 18 months old. It's amazing what has happened in that time and we all know that we owe it all to you, the listeners. Without you tuning in every week, getting involved, asking questions, promoting us and letting us know when we fall short, we wouldn't be here. I just want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for everything you've done to get us to this point. All of us at the network cannot wait to share what comes next. Thank you all so much.

I'm not only a fan of 70Decibels and 5by5 but also, I'm glad to say, Myke's friend. I couldn't be happier for him and this merger is one step closer to him going full time as a podcaster extraordinaire. Myke and Dan announced and talked at length about the merger, as well as podcasting in general on [CMD+Space 033](http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/3/13/033-a-big-announcement-with-dan-benjamin.html).
