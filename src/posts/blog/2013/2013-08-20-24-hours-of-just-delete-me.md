“_I’m sure I’ll get a couple of hundred visitors_”. That’s what I was thinking yesterday when I launched [justdelete.me](http://justdelete.me). I wasn’t completely wrong.

The response to justdelete.me has been incredible. In just 24 hours it was linked to by [Minimal Mac](http://minimalmac.com/post/58698882020/robb-lewis-just-delete-me) (swoon!), tweeted and retweeted by hundreds of people and had over 3000 visitors. 

Since launch five additional services have been added: Reddit, Lovefilm, MySpace, Amazon and Klout. To add Klout, I had to sign up for it to immediately delete my account. I saw things. Crazy, strange things. How’s that for dedication?

Other stats of note:

  * Visitors from over 70 different countries
  * Around 30% of people were using Chrome
  * Someone from [Apple visited](http://d.pr/i/I8JN)
  * The top three operating systems were OS X 10.8, iOS 6.1 and Windows 7

Also Ed, who designed the site, isn’t getting anywhere near enough credit for the project so [go visit his portfolio](http://edpoole.me/portfolio).
