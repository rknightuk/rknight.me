Whilst creating a document which requires me to put some data (which isn't in the slightest way tabular data) into a table, I wanted to create the table with no headers. However the way markdown works mean it requires you to set a header for it to create a table in the first place. By using the HTML non-breaking space entity it can be done:

```markdown
&nbsp; | &nbsp;
------ | -----
Stuff  | More things
```

Simple.
