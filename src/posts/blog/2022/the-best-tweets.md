A few days ago [James Thomson posted](https://twitter.com/jamesthomson/status/1591538731756191745) that you can find your tweets based on how many likes they got with the following link (switching my username for yours):

[https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arknightuk%20min_faves%3A1000&src=typed_query&f=live](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Arknightuk%20min_faves%3A1000&src=typed_query&f=live)

I think it's very likely my account will be deleted at some point so I figured I'd have a little look at my best tweets and archive them here (I am using "best" in the loosest possible way here).

**Back to the Future Day tweet - 2015-10-21 ([link](https://hellsite.rknight.me/656762307494682624)**)

This has a typo that will haunt me forever (should be "Emmett" not "Emmet").

> “Are you Marty McFly? I’ve got something for you”
>
> *opens letter*
>
> “Emmet Brown would like you to join his professional network on LinkedIn”

I also did <s>the same tweet</s> a totally original tweet when GDPR caused everyone to send a thousand emails ([link](https://hellsite.rknight.me/999648514534764544)).

> “Are you Marty McFly? I’ve got something for you”
>
> *opens letter*
>
> “Please confirm you want to continue to receive letters from Dr. Emmett Brown”

**Alt Key - 2016-08-21 ([link](https://hellsite.rknight.me/767337245133144064))**

> The alt symbol (⌥) is like a track switch. An alternate route. Alt.
>
> Mind blown.

**Dark Pattern - 2018-05-27 ([link](https://hellsite.rknight.me/1000748036367310848))**

> This “no I hate myself” pattern is horrible.

**Boris × Thanos - 2022-10-20 ([link](https://hellsite.rknight.me/1583079656760410112))**

I didn't make this image. I had the idea and then grabbed the image from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mattlcapon/status/1421631601902039043).

> "You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me"
