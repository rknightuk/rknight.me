During the pandemic Max Braun managed to squeeze a Pi Zero with camera module [into an Apple iSight camera](https://debugger.medium.com/todays-webcams-are-boring-so-i-brought-back-a-classic-291cc7c94c76). I came across the post a few weeks ago and decided to have a go myself.

Despite the [Rapsberry Pi shortage](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-shortages-and-our-first-ever-price-increase/) I was able to order a Pi Zero, the [camera module](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-camera-module-v2?variant=19833929735), the [Pi Zero camera cable](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/camera-cable-raspberry-pi-zero-edition?variant=32092803891283), and an [iSight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISight). I ordered the [3D-printed internal chassis](https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/blob/master/PiSight.stl) and [this USB adaptor](https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/issues/16) from [SGD3D](https://sgd3d.co.uk) which took about a week to arrive.

I followed these [iFixIt teardowns](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Apple_iSight_Webcam) to work out how to take the iSight apart, then looked at the [issues on the PiSight repo](https://github.com/maxbbraun/pisight/issues), and [this blog post](https://muffinresearch.co.uk/building-a-pisight/), to see other people putting theirs together. The main issue I had was having to trimming off the bottom two corners of the camera module to be able to fit it inside the iSight tube. I used [`showmewebcam`](https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam) for the software, which boots incredibly quickly and makes it very easy to get going.

Once I'd wrangled it all together I used [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app) to check everything was working (the lighting is terrible in this temporary office hence why it's looks so bad):

It may not be the best webcam in the world, but it's easily as good as the one I have in my MacBook, and I can move it around wherever I want.
