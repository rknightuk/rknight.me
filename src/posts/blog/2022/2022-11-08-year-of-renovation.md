We moved into our house November 3rd 2021, just over a year ago. Most of the house hadn't been decorated since it was built in the '70s so everything needed redoing. With the exception of a few carpets and a bit of painting, everything is now done.

### Kitchen

This was the biggest project. We extended into the garage to make a kitchen/diner and add a utility room.
