[Apple Music Replay](http://replay.music.apple.com) is a vast improvement on last year. I grabbed some of the data so I have a record of it (I have no idea if you can access a previous years data or not).

No suprises Hamilton is top again with Lin-Manuel Miranda and Leslie Odom, Jr. taking 2 of the top artist spots. Combined, they take the real top spot.

I was in the top 100 listeners for Punk Rock Factory and Goldfinger. 

**3695 songs**

**231 Albums**

I have no idea how it works out the play count on albums but I assume this is individual tracks so I've worked out the times I've played an album based on this. Apple doesn't give numbers for albums 6-10.
