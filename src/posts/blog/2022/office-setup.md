A couple of weeks ago I posted a photo in the MacStories Discord and Federico <s>demanded</s> asked very nicely if I would write about it, so here we are. I have a lot of consoles which means I have a lot of games and controllers. I’ve never been one to sell games after I’ve finished them so I always had a collection of some sort. I worked at a second hand game shop while I was at university so my collection grew rapidly in the 11 months I was there and I have continued to pick up games here and there over the years. As of right now I have 315 games across 12 systems, a third of which are for the PlayStation 2. A lot of my all-time favourite games are for the PS2 including:

- Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 and 4
- Jak and Daxter
- Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (side note: despite the launch bugs, the remaster version of this is excellent)
- Mashed: Fully Loaded

I’m a big fan of single-player story-driven games so the majority of my collection are those types of games. I’m currently playing through Horizon Forbidden West which I am loving.

My setup consists of a PS5, a PS3, a pink PS2 which I adore, an Xbox 360, and an Xbox One all hooked up to a HiSense 4K 43" TV that I bought a few years ago. I’m not sure in 2022 if I would even be able to buy a TV with this many inputs. The modern consoles use HDMI and the PS2 and 360 use [SCART cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCART) which was widely used on TVs in the UK and Europe and is somewhat better than using component input.

I use [GameEye](https://gameye.app/) to keep track of my the games and consoles I own. I log the games I’ve played with Almanac, a custom blogging system I made for tracking things I’ve watched and played. (Update: I now use [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/rknightuk) for this). In my attic I have a Sega Master System, Nintendo 64, and a Nintendo Wii, plus there is a Nintendo Switch in the living room.

Until I add shelves to my office to have at least some of my games on display, I’m using the built-in cupboard as storage for my games. I built the shelves in there myself so they are a perfect size for double-stacking games. I added an [Ikea Skadis](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skadis-pegboard-combination-white-s09216595/) to the inside of the door to various gaming-related things like cables, controllers, and memory cards for the older consoles.

I have some ideas for the office including a custom controller holder, shelves to display my games and my many collector’s edition statues (these are also in storage right now), and I’m also considering wall-mounting the TV. I also need to alphabetise the games instead of dumping them in the cupboard like they are right now.
