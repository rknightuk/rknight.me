[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) has support for following and replying to Mastodon users but getting from someone's profile on Mastodon to the follow page on Micro.blog can be a pain. To search for a user you need have it in the format of `cooluser@mastodon.instance` which isn't the same as the profile URLs. To make this easier I made a shortcut that does the following:

1. Takes the current Safari URL, for example `https://mastodon.instance/@cooluser`
2. Gets the domain (`mastodon.instance`) and the path (`@cooluser`)
3. Swaps those round to become `cooluser@mastodon.instance`
4. Opens the page on Micro.blog to be able to follow that user (`https://micro.blog/cooluser@mastodon.instance`)

It will also check to see if the path/username contains an `@` symbol and if it doesn't will show an alert instead. This isn't ideal but given that Mastodon can have any domain, it's much harder to detect if it's a Mastodon site or not. 

There is a meta tag in the HTML with `profile:username` as the property name but I don't know enough about Shortcuts to do this.
