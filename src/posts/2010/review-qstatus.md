If you want to add what music you are listening to, simply press the music note icon and the artist, song title and URL will be added. The location icon can be used to either geotag your status, add a map URL or update your profile location. qStatus also includes a Twitter trends browser, URL shortening and saving of drafts. Once you've added all this extra information to your status, hit the update status button and you're done. 

### The Breakdown

#### The Good

qStatus does exactly what it should do and it does it well. The interface is easy to use and has all the bells and whistles, such as photo and video upload, now playing and geotagging. The ability to change the background gives users the option to personalise the app, and multiple account support is a welcome addition. 

#### The Bad

qStatus does not offer a choice of services for video and photo upload, which might put some people off to prefer a different service to TwitPic and TwitVid, which are the defaults. The URL shortening uses qStatus's own service, which means you won't be able to track clicks on your links using a bit.ly API key.

### The Verdict

The lack of choice in terms of photo upload and URL shortening may put some advanced users off of qStatus, but as a quick and easy method of updating Facebook and Twitter simultaneously, this app is the perfect choice.
