Inspired by [Marco](https://mb.esamecar.net/2023/12/13/state-of-app.html) and [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/on-subscriptions), here is the current state of my subscriptions. Any prices that were in dollars I've converted to GBP. Anything I pay for yearly I've divided by 12 and marked them as such.

### Miscellanea

I pay for [Apple One Premier](https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-one/) at £36.95 per month which includes Apple TV+, iCloud Storage, and Apple Music for me and my wife but I'll include it in the streaming section for the sake of clarity.

I have a 1Password Family account but I get this for free through my job.

### Streaming

- Netflix (£7.99 / month). We cheap out on this because it's mostly for my wife to watch old crime documenataries and the quality doesn't really matter
- Disney+ (£10.99 / month). We don't actually pay for this, instead we use out Tesco Clubcard vouchers every three months instead.
- Amazon Prime (£7.99 / month (paid yearly)). We don't so much pay for this as we just get it included because we want quick delivery. 
- Apple TV+, Apple Music (£36.95 / month).
- **Total:** £63.92 / month

### Memberships

- [Connected Pro/Relay FM](http://getconnectedpro.co) (£4 / month). Ad-free episodes with extra content for connected, bonus episodes and access to the Relay Discord.
- [Hemispheric Views One Prime Plus](https://oneprimeplus.com/) (£4 / month). Bonus episodes, a newsletter, access to a members-only Discord channel, plus some dandy stickers. I _just_ bumped this from $2 to $5 because I'm not convinced much of my $2 is actually reaching them once you account for fees and whatnot.
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) (£4 / month). I build so many of my sites with Eleventy, it's a no-brainer.
- **Total:** £12 / month

### Apps and Services

- [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb) (£1.33 / month (paid annually)). My main use is the [Mastodon instance](https://social.lol) but it has loads of stuff. Read [Blake's post](https://blakewatson.com/journal/omg-lol-an-oasis-on-the-internet/) for a better overview than I could ever write. 
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=8e1d8283bd20) (£12 / month). Hosting for this website and all my [side projects](https://rknight.me/projects).
- [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/IXCLSF) (£11 / month). Analytics I use for my sites. Worth noting here I get ~$7/$5 back each month thanks to referrals so the actual price paid here is ~£6.
- [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net/?ref=b2i4y24apu) (£1 / month). Currently only using this to host the files for [We Got Family](https://wegot.family/).
- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) (£2 / month (paid yearly)). The best Mastodon client on the Mac and iOS.
- **Total:** £25.33 / month


### Grand Total

£101.25 isn't too bad considering everything I'm getting for that. Not sure what conclusion to draw from this, nothing here I really need to cut. Maybe if it goes much higher I'll think about it some more.
