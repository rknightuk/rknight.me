excerpt: "Why I'm not rating movies any more"

When I used to use [Plot](http://plotapp.io/) (RIP) to track movies that had a thumbs up or down system. When I switched to my own CMS for this I did the same thing. Then when I switched to Letterboxd I translated what was essentially a 1-3 rating system to the five-star system (even though it's actually out of ten not five) Letterboxd uses. From [my Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/):

> ★☆☆☆☆ : Never again
> 
> ★★★☆☆ : Fine
> 
> ★★★★★ : Good movie, would watch again

The problem with this system is I mostly don't watch bad movies. Or a better way to put it is I kinda like [bad movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_&_Furious). Despite knowing intellectually that [Shawshank Redemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption) is a "better" movie than [Olympus Has Fallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Has_Fallen) they're both rated 5 stars in my system. I could change my system to use the full spectrum of the five stars but I just don't have the energy or the inclination to do it. How do I decide what gets 4.5 stars and what gets a 5? Is there really a discernible difference between those two ratings? Also, who gives a shit what number I've ordained upon a movie?

So fuck it. No more ratings.
