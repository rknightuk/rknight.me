tl;dr: You can't set full screen artwork without being featured by Apple.

In iOS17, the Apple Podcasts app has (for some shows) fancy new full screen artwork but I noticed that [my](https://ruminatepodcast.com) [shows](https://wegot.family) don't.

After some hunting around, some [tooting](https://social.lol/@robb/111105291859489382), and messaging [John](https://mastodon.macstories.net/@johnvoorhees), I came across [this page](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/866-promotional-artwork) that outlines the full screen artwork. It explains the sizes for hero images, channel covers, and full page show art. It even has photoshop templates. My podcasts are unlikely to be featured but I figured it was worth a shot.

Once I made the art and hit the submit button, it turns out you can _only_ submit hero images and if Apple then deems my show worthy enough for a feature will they then request the full page art.

This feels really shitty that you have to get featured just to get nicer artwork in the Apple Podcasts app which is far and away the most popular podcast app.
