I got married and had a child. No time for anything else. Thank you for reading.

### Writing

This year I wrote 60 blog posts including this one which is a big jump compared to last year's 19. My most popular posts[^1] for the year are:

- [Please, Expose your RSS](https://rknight.me/please-expose-your-rss/) - this one hit the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38595855)
- [App Defaults](https://rknight.me/app-defaults/) - see the everything else section below for more info on this
- [Adding Webmentions to Your Site](https://rknight.me//adding-webmentions-to-your-site/)
- [Automating My Now Page](https://rknight.me//automating-my-now-page/)
- [Using PageFind with Eleventy for Search](https://rknight.me/using-pagefind-with-eleventy-for-search/)
### Media

#### Movies

Checking my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk) I only watched a handful of _new-to-me_ movies this year. [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9114286/) and [Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954600/) were equally disappointing in their own special ways. _Barbie_ was...fine? Maybe the hype set my expectations too high but it was fine. Whatever. It's a sad state of affairs that [Superfast!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2933474/) was the best new-to-me movie I watched this year (here my review on [episode 5 of We Got Family](https://wegot.family/5/)).
#### TV

Just two shows jump out at me as worth recommending this year:

- [Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)
- [The Last of Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3581920/) accompanied with [The Incomparable's _The Cast of Us_ podcast](https://www.theincomparable.com/tcou/)
I have yet to watch For All Mankind season 4 and the Scott Pilgrim show.
#### Music

I've continued to use [my MusicThread shortcut](https://rknight.me/add-to-musicthread-shortcut/) to send new albums and tracks to the relevant playlists:

- [2023 Albums](https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6LZz60026Onq3waGuwt7WdJ5x)
- [2023 Tracks](https://musicthread.app/thread/2L6IuBPKCCo7fsA8SFyXZLirH5W)

[Punk Tactics by Joey Valence & Brae](https://musicthread.app/link/2VIGOGRMFyCta6smxRY0H5jKPQq) has easily been my favourite album of the year, with [One More Time by blink-182](https://musicthread.app/link/2X1GTScJIyLzJugjczig4sWFn66) a close second. The [Meteora 20th Anniversary Edition](https://musicthread.app/link/2YgZCdX5aTVecEnkxXiVFpnTRaI?share_prompt=1) was also in heavy rotation for me this year as well. According to Apple Music my top artists were (I promise this is a 2023 list and not 2005):

1. Linkin Park
2. Simple Plan
3. Punk Rock Factory
4. Blink 182
5. State Champs
6. Zebrahead
7. Bowling for Soup
8. Allister (top 100 listeners!)
9. Eminem
10. Story of the Year
#### Games

According to Playstation Wrap-Up, I played four games this year:

- Last of Us Part 1
- Stray
- Spider-Man 2
- Guardian of the Galaxy

Of those I stopped playing Guardians because I found it boring and I'm halfway through Spider-Man and Last of Us. Stray is the only game I've finished.
#### Books

In [last year's end of year post](https://rknight.me/just-2022-things/) I said:

> I did start [Men Who Hate Women](https://micro.blog/books/9781728236254) and hopefully will finish it soon.

I did not finish it yet. Maybe next year. The only book I read this year was the [Johnny Decimal workbook](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/14-build-your-system/14.02-the-decimal-workbook/) which I enjoyed so much I [wrote a post about it](https://rknight.me/using-the-johnny-decimal-system/).

#### Podcasts

The only new podcast I added to [my subscriptions](http://localhost:8080/podcasts/roll/) is [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/). I enjoyed it so much I went back and [listened to all 78 episodes](http://localhost:8080/three-years-of-hemispheric-views-feedback/) over three months. Hemispheric Views was also how [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) started, more about that below.
### Side Projects

#### January: omg! lol!

At the start of the year I switched over to social.lol and using Mastodon rather than micro.blog which led to a few related projects:

- [omglolcli](https://github.com/rknightuk/omglolcli)
- [recentfm.js](https://recentfm.rknight.me/)
- [omgnow.js](https://omgnow.rknight.me/)
- [Echo](https://echo.rknight.me/)
- [Lantern](https://lantern.rknight.me/)

Echo I am still using heavily and I know that RecentFM and omgnow.js is being used by at least a few people. I have plans to make Echo a more user-friendly project but that's a way off yet I think.
#### September: The Donation Daddy Cometh

This year I was organised enough to setup a sub-campaign for [Relay's annual St Jude fundraising campaign](https://relay.experience.stjude.org) and I (with the help of [Adam](https://neatnik.net)) was able to raise $12,590.57. You can [read the blog post here](/st-jude-2023-final-numbers/) for more of the juicy details on the campaign itself.

The _real_ fun (aside from raising lots of money of course) comes from the japes in the Relay discord. It started with [Septembed](http://septembed.rknight.me), then [deskmat.help](https://deskmat.help), then [Coin Me, Daddy](https://coinme.dad/dy), and finally [Donation Treats](https://donationtreats.rknight.me). These were all separate websites for the majority of the campaign but towards the end I merged them into a single project for my own sanity and slapped Zach's incredible [donation daddy logo on it](https://donationdaddy.rknight.me). I can't wait for next year, me and Adam have some fun ideas already (it's basically September anyway).

We also sent out over 100 sets of stickers to people who donated. I was pretty proud of how well the stickers I designed looked, so much so I made the Ruminate one our proper artwork.

#### Everything Else

- [Mac 30th Anniversary Icons](https://rknightuk.github.io/mac-30-font-svg/). I couldn't have done with without [Keir](https://keiransell.com/) and [Josh](https://calvetti.me/)
- [Brian Butterfield Diet Soundboard](https://treatday.rknight.me/). One of the more popular projects. It keeps ending up getting posted on random newsletters, gets a big spike of traffic, then dies down again. I use it all the time.
- [Bugle](https://bugle.lol/) - My ActivityPub server I'm using for [We Got Family](https://bugle.lol/@wegotfamily) and [my bots](https://knightbot.rknight.me)
- [Custom Finder Sidebar Icons](https://github.com/rknightuk/custom-finder-sidebar-icons). A fun but frustrating project I did with Keir
- [We Got Family Podcast](https://wegot.family/). We got a bit behind on this but we will finish it. It's been a lot of fun talking about the Fast and Furious movies.
- [Podcast Duration Calculator](https://podduration.rknight.me/) and [Defocused vs. the Movies](https://defocused-vs-the-movies.netlify.app/). I don't even remember why I wanted to know how many hours of audio a podcast was but these two projects were a result of that. 
- Secret Relay.fm project. Can't say what this is but it involved the Google Sheets API and Eleventy data files.
- [VLCNR](https://vlcnr.rknight.me/). I had wanted to revive this app for a while and finally found the time to do it. 
- [App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/). My most popular project this year by far. In the 50 days from launching it there was only three days where I didn't have to add at least one site to the list. As of today, there are 282 blog posts.
- [Pokédon](https://pokedon.rknight.me/). My first hackathon in seven years, this time on my own instead of part of [my team](https://devsdodesign). I think I spent more time on the Pokédex design that I did the actual code.
- [DoubleShift](https://doubleshift.rknight.me) and [Crossover](https://crossover.rknight.me). Two projects that scratched an itch for me to know where I'd seen other actors in similar shows. A lot fun data stuff in here.
- [Eleventy Post Graph](https://postgraph.rknight.me/). The graph I added on my stats page was pretty popular so I made it into an Eleventy Plugin. This was also somehow the first time I've published an npm package. [Read the blog post](https://rknight.me/eleventy-post-graph-plugin/).
- This site. Last month I redesigned the site after seeing [SimpleBits Cartridge font](https://simplebits.shop/products/cartridge) and knew I had to use it somewhere. Now I've redesigned it to make it more flexible I can start porting over some of the content from [the Intersect](https://intersect.rknight.me).

It's been a pretty good year all told. Now if I could find a way to get paid to make stupid web apps all day that'd be great.

[^1]: I've excluded [these](https://rknight.me/convert-spotify-facebook-to-email-login/) [two](https://rknight.me//create-a-blank-no-header-markdown-table/) posts because although they are really popular they are very boring
