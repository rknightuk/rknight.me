Congratulations on subscribing via RSS, you get these bonus posts. Lucky you. Welcome to the Knight Club[^1].

What am I going to post here? Not a clue to be honest but there are things that I want to talk about that don't need to be full posts. I might "release" these into the [main archive page](/blog) after a year or so, mostly for my own sanity of finding them.

It's two days before the end of 2023 so I want to write down what projects I plan to do in the next 12 months. I don't mind talking about what I'm working on but I don't think a "proper" blog post makes sense until I have something to release. Firstly, I have a couple of in progress projects I want to finish.

Meta checker (I will come up with a better name) is similar to [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/) but more suited to the specific things I want to check for a website: favicon, Safari accent color, is the RSS feed auto-detectable, those kinds of things. It will serve as a checklist of sorts for when I'm nearly done with a project.

The second is [Echo](https://echo.rknight.me/). I want to make this a more friendly service for non-tech people to use. Right now it requires NodeJS knowledge, a horrible Javascript config file, and a pocket full of hopes and dreams.

Now for the new projects. The first is a GitHub-based CMS, similar to [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/). If you follow me on Mastodon, you'll know I've had _a lot_ of issues with getting Tina set up. I'm not sure how their backend works but it is definitely more complicated than it needs to be. I think I can make something more suited to what I want and hopefully what other people want.

The second project has already been through multiple iterations: Almanac. A media logging website. Think Letterboxd but for everything: movies, TV shows, podcasts, music, books. I initially wanted to make this a service people signed up for and used but the licensing around the data just isn't worth the hassle. So instead, I'm going to make it a self-hosted, bring-your-own-api-keys site. It'll have a nice API to be able to update my [/now page](/now), feeds to auto-post to Mastodon, and some other fun stuff. The API itself is done but I need to consider how I want the front end to work.

Finally, webmentions. How do they work? I [wrote a post about it](https://rknight.me/blog/adding-webmentions-to-your-site/) and I'm still not entirely sure. I'm relying on [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) and [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) but _how_ do they work? I want to make my own thing to handle webmentions and conversation from Mastodon but I need to dig into the formats first.

That's it for now, have a great new years!
