I'm not signing up to any service that doesn't offer at minimum RSS feeds for my data. Ideally an API, even a simple one. No more apps that aren't [part of the web](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2022/11/psa-do-not-use-services-that-hate-the-internet/). I'm done.

To quote [Sophie](https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/):

Is it too much to ask for an RSS feed of listen history from my podcast apps? Every single one of them collects and stores that data but (as far as I know) don't make that data available easily via RSS or an API. One of the apps must have this, please let me know.

There are a loads of mobile apps for tracking game collections, movies watched, habits logged, but most of of them have no way to access the data on the web, let alone programatically; god forbid I want to access stuff from a browser on my Mac instead of using my phone all the time.

I shouldn't need to set a reminder every week/month/year to go and request an export of _my_ data just to have it backed up, posted to my blog, or whatever else I want to do with it.

I'm done with closed services.
