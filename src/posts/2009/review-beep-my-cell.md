Do you ever put your phone down and then spend ages trying to find it again? Well that’s where Beep My Cell comes in.

Beep My Cell uses push notifications to make your iPhone continuously beep until you find it. Setting it up is as easy as inputting your email address and your password. To find your phone, simply log onto beepmycell.com, login and then click the huge ’start beeping’ button. You can add as many iPhones as you wish to one account, so you could have a single account for the whole family. The web interface is simple, easy to use and loads very quickly which is good. The app itself, only has two options, login or create account.

During my tests, the push notifications started almost instantly every time. The sound produced is a foghorn style sound, so it can be easily heard. This app is a simple one, but it one of the most useful apps I have. Beep My Cell is a great purchase, especially if you are constantly misplacing your phone.
