Free WiFi Cafe Spots is an application listing free wifi throughout the US, Canada, and Europe. On opening the application you are asked to share your location, which then produces a list of free wifi spots in the surrounding area.

I tested this in my local area (Portsmouth, UK) and it listed a few spots that I was aware of but I knew that there were quite a few missing. The developer did tell me there were omissions before I reviewed the app, and that the next update would add quite a few more. The way this is going to be improved is through the built in feedback system, which allows users to confirm, edit or add locations.

Through the feedback system I was able to add a local pub, which I visited.

Looking at locations elsewhere, cities across the US and Canada had a huge amount of locations available. The best feature about this app is the ability to view locations without an internet connection. This is great if you were visiting a city and wanted to check for free wifi spots before you go.

The interface could do with some improvements and with an increased amount of locations, this could become an app that everyone will want to keep with them at all times. As it is though, this app gets 6.5 out of 10.
