Status Symbols, according to the developer, is ‘Sign language for what’s on your mind’. Basically, Status Symbols is a set of flash cards for getting a message to people when you shouldn’t be speaking (cinema, library, etc) or can’t be heard (in a noisy club or at a concert). That’s the idea anyway.

The app has 17 different ’status symbols’ to use, from ‘Bathroom break’ (below) to more obscure ones such as ‘check the ring finger’ and ‘eye contact’. These are presented in a scrollable list of thumbnails and accompanying text (although it doesn’t take long to scroll through only 17 of them). Selecting a symbol brings the symbol up in full screen for you to wave at your mates across the club, pressing the screen returns to the list of symbols.

The symbols, despite (probably) getting the message across, are not very high quality. They look as though they have been drawn in MSpaint, and in quite a rush as well. I can’t imagine myself using this in a real world situation, and I am regularly at places this app is specifically designed for. Perhaps if this app was free, I wouldn’t be so critical, but it isn’t. To pay $0.99 for something that could be be achieved in the photos app by adding your own personalised ’status symbols’, it just isn’t justifiable. If there was a much larger catalogue of images, this app might be worth the money. But as it is, with the small amount of images, and low quality ones at that, this isn’t something I would recommend.
