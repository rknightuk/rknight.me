Do you like puzzle games? Do you like puzzle games that are so simple yet infuriating at the same time? Yeah, me too. Rack Brains is exactly that.

The objective of Rack Brains is to clear each puzzle by moving blocks to create rows of three or more. Seems simple enough until you factor in the limited amount of moves that you get for each puzzle. When you get three of the same coloured blocks in a row they dissapear, thus moving the blocks above down a place. The first couple of puzzles are pretty simple, but after that they get extremely difficult. There are a total of 35 puzzles to complete in order to finish the game, at which point, according to the iTunes description, “you will get a big surprise”. I’d love to be able to say I’ve got my surrpise but even after a week of playing at least an hour a day, I’m stuck on puzzle 21.

Rack Brains is incredibly simple in principal, but in theory it is ridiculously hard to complete. If you fail to complete a puzzle, you get a message asking if you want to try again, or one of many silly options such as ‘Not OK’, ‘Kill Me’ and ‘Walkthrough’. Clicking any of these options takes you back to the levels overview, so don’t think there’s an easy way out. At $0.99 this app is worth buying and all you puzzle lovers out there will be as infuriated and in love with Rack Brains as I am.
