Inspired by [Sophie's post](https://localghost.dev/blog/2022-the-year-in-lists/) I decided to do a little roundup of things I've done the year.

### House Project

We purchased our house in November 2021 and it hadn't been decorated since 1971 so everything needed doing; most of this year has been spent getting all the rooms fixed up. In July, we found out my partner was pregnant (🎉) which is very exciting but also added an extra bit of stress to making sure the house was done by the end of this year. Things I learnt how to do:

- [Fitting laminate flooring](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/11/06/its-finally-finished.html) - This isn't difficult per se, but it is _hard_ work.
- [Wallpapering](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/08/07/my-first-and.html) - This is a pain in the arse, I hate it, and will never do it again. I do like the finished wall [now it has the mirror and radiator though](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/27/final-floor-in.html).
- [Installing skirting boards](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/11/24/in-better-news.html) - Again, a bit of a pain but with a decent mitre saw and some [Gripfill](https://trade.evo-stik.co.uk/products/grab-adhesives/gripfill) it doesn't take too long.
- [Building a desk from scratch](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/04/06/im-like-ron.html) - This was a fun woodworking project. I'm pretty happy with [how it turned out.](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/04/22/i-heard-were.html)

### Travel

In February we went to Rome, visited all the normal sites, and ate so much [incredible pizza](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/02/24/pizza.html). We stayed right near [The Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome) which was perfect for walking everywhere we needed to go.

In April we went to Bournemouth for a few days and saw [Bowling for Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_for_Soup) on the last day.

Right before Christmas we went to Edinburgh to visit the Christmas market (which was a bit disappointing) but we did a tour of the [Edinburgh Vaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Vaults), rubbed the nose of [Greyfriar's Bobby](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/12/19/edinburgh-day.html), and visited some great book shops.

We saw a bunch of theatre shows this year as well:

- [Hamilton](https://www.hamiltonwestendshop.com)
- [Six](https://www.sixthemusical.com)
- [Book of Mormon](https://thebookofmormonmusical.com/london/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=google&campaign_id=17961066709&adset_id=&ad_id=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtbqdBhDvARIsAGYnXBPs12fWJd3GhcOAKGkJVZVY33b3MIfGN8yz0HqLDzKh0NCaommr2GQaAgAPEALw_wcB)
- [Back to the Future: The Musical](https://www.backtothefuturemusical.com)
- [Cinderella](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(Lloyd_Webber_musical)>) - This was an interesting one because the front 8 rows rotate with the stage so you're facing everyone else. This got cancelled right after we saw it.

### Web

I made a bunch of little plugins/webapps for [Micro.blog](https://mbtools.rknight.me) and the [Monzo Pot Image Generator](https://potimages.rknight.me) hit over 40k images generated. I stopped using Twitter so I'm [using a combination](https://rknight.me/two-social-networks-in-this-economy/) of [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and Mastodon - the latter is run by [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/robb). omg.lol is such a fun site and has a bunch of services, including a Mastodon instance. You can get it for $5 a year until tomorrow.

### Games

I didn't play many games due to the aforementioned home project but I did manage to play through the [GTA Trilogy](https://store.rockstargames.com/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition) as well as [Horizon Forbidden West](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-forbidden-west/).

### Movies

According to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/films/diary/for/2022/) I've watched 103 movies this year. Of those, 12 of them came out this year. My favourites of those are:

- [Thor: Love and Thunder](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/thor-love-and-thunder/1/) - This movie is a bit divisive but I loved it.
- [Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/) - An excellent sequel to Knives Out.
- [The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special](https://letterboxd.com/rknightuk/film/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/) - This was so much fun and [the main song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E1ULv6LcOk) is a banger.

### TV

I didn't watch all that much TV this year but the two stands outs were:

- [Reacher](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/07/14/finished-the-first.html) -  As a fan of the books, I was impressed how closely this matched up. A really great adaptation.
- [Better Call Saul](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/08/16/cant-believe-better.html) - This show is perfect in every way.
- [For All Mankind](https://toot.rknight.me/2022/09/09/for-all-mankind.html) - No other show builds suspense like For All Mankind does

## Books

I read zero books this year which is embarrassing, I hope to change this next year. I did start [Men Who Hate Women](https://micro.blog/books/9781728236254) and hopefully will finish it soon.
