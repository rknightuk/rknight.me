It's been a really good year for music especially for artists I've been listening to for years.

- [Avril Lavinge - Love Sux](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/love-sux-deluxe/1655449416) - This is the link to the deluxe version which contains some excellent acoustic versions of some of the tracks.
- [State Champs - Kings of the New Age](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/kings-of-the-new-age/1607207409)
- [Simple Plan - Hard Than It Looks](https://music.apple.com/us/album/harder-than-it-looks/1600965603) - This is as good an album as they've ever made.
- [Demi Levato - HOLY FVCK](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/holy-fvck/1628440994) - this was a suprise entry for me, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do.
- [Jaret Jay Reddick - Just Woke Up](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/just-woke-up/1603918127)
- [Beefy - Super Relatable](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/super-relatable/1637732324)
- [Punk Rock Factory - A Whole New Wurst 2](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/a-whole-new-wurst-2/1625667455) - Their  cover of _Surface Pressure_ is amazing.

The released tracks on [Story of the Year's new album](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/tear-me-to-pieces/1647133854) are fantastic. I can't wait to hear the rest of them.

Finally I discovered [Never Look Back by Goldfinger](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/never-look-back-deluxe/1634447768). Apparently it came out in 2020 and I completely missed it. There's a great version of _Here In Your Bedroom_ featuring Avril on this deluxe version of the album.
