**[My two month Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/rmlewisuk/status/921450441375977472):**

Rachel should have dumped Ross's jealous ass as soon as the Mark thing started. Urgh.

This tweet brought to you by 1997.

That thread was right, Ross is a complete tool.

Ross is making me so angry. I wanna punch his stupid face.

"Maybe we should take a break"

OH SHITS ABOUT TO KICK OFF

Hmm. I don't think they were on a break.

Wait, no. Rachel says they were broken up.

Oh wow Ross got a laserdisc player.

"I'll get my own dollhouse with blackjack and hookers"

Phoebe did it first.

Found my HD rips. No more 4:3 Friends for me.

SUCH QUALITY

Only now, because it's in HD, have I realised Kathy isn't played by Amanda Peet. My whole life is a lie.

I can't believe he said Rachel's name instead of Emily.

The way they try and get the sofa up the stairs is ridiculous.

So much fragile masculinity in "The One with Ross' Teeth"

Why didn't Ross just say "oh I fucked up my teeth lol". That would have fixed everything

I would have eaten Rachel's beef trifle.

NOT a euphemism

Richard is terrible. He shouldn’t have told Monica he still loved her.

“It’s just good sense to backup your backup”

Phoebe was ahead of her time.

Joey and Rachel should have ended up together.

Nope. Not finished yet.

👏 Paul Rudd 👏

Paul Rudd has all the best lines in season 10.

Oh no not Mark again.

Ross is awful but I still don’t think I’m emotionally ready for the last episode.

Aaaand finished. Thanks for playing.
