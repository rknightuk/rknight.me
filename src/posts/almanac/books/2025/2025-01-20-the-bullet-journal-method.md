I'd watched a bunch of the intro videos online but reading the book with examples side-by-side helped solidify some of the system and ideas.

I like the suggestion of an imperfection collection - "_somewhere in your notebook, dedicate space where you just let go._" I've been guilty of needing notebooks to be perfect in the past.

It does have that classic self-help/business book energy where the author just happens to have had an inexplicable experience that perfectly encapsulates the point they're trying to make but thankfully there's only a couple of those.

This line made me laugh:

> We can find countless reasons to be hard on ourselves, especially if we are insecure, are sensitive, or breathe.

Some concepts I'd not heard of before:

- [Hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) - "_the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness (or sadness) despite major positive or negative events_"
- [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) - "_Ikigai can be described as having a sense of purpose in life, as well as being motivated_"

Also, [there are spin-off systems from BuJo](https://thecalendex.com/get_started/) because of course there is.
