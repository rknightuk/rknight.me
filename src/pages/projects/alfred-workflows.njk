<p>The workflows below are all built by me using a combination of bash and/or <a href="https://github.com/JXA-Cookbook/JXA-Cookbook">JXA</a>. Some of them will be useful to other people, like the Audio Device Switcher, but others are very specific to me and my setup.</p>

<p>None of the workflows require any additional dependencies with the exception of the audio-related ones which require <a href="https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx">switchaudio-osx</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the third-party workflows I use, there is a <a href="https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows#third-party-workflows">list on GitHub</a>.</p>
