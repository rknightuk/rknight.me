De-stem and cut the @Habaneros{115%g} in half, chop the @Onion{1} roughly & peel the @Garlic Cloves{4}.

Arrange the habaneros, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet. Cover lightly in @Olive Oil{} and bake at 200Â°c for ~{15-20%minutes}, or until you start to see it browning on the edges.

Put the roasted items, @Salt{15%g}, @Baby Carrots{130%g}, @Peaches in Syrup{225%g}, @Vinegar{15%g}, and @Ground Ginger{5%g} into a blender with 1/2 cup of water. Puree, strain, enjoy!
