- For small things [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@robb) is nice and easy and you'll probably get a response quickly
- If you have my phone number iMessage and WhatsApp any time
- If you've found a bug in one of my projects, file an issue on GitHub against the repo (if you can)
- Failing that, email is also a thing that exists <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0072\u006f\u0062\u0062\u0040\u006f\u006d\u0067\u002e\u006c\u006f\u006c';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u0072\u006f\u0062\u0062\u0040\u006f\u006d\u0067\u002e\u006c\u006f\u006c')</script></a>
- I have an X account but I don't check it. Same with LinkedIn but I _do_ check that occasionally.
