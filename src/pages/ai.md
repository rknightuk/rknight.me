Every word on this site, and my others sites, was written by me, a human being. None of the images were generated with AI. 

I will sometimes use AI tools to generate regular expressions (if [Zoe](https://zoeaubert.me) isn't available) for particualy complicated things because I'm bad at regex no matter how hard I try. Don't send me regex 101 or whatever, I know, I still suck at it.

I use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) when writing code, usually for autofilling things like lists of numbers and other asinine tasks that occur when programming. Occassionally it will understand what I'm trying to do so I will use that code if I'm sure it's correct.

I've used AI images for two things: a handful of times when DALLÂ·E first released just try it out and for a couple of months with the [bad movie remakes bot](https://bugle.lol/@movieremakes). None of those images were good, a couple maybe got a little chuckle, but on the whole it wasn't worth it. Even if generated images get better, the resource usage to generate one single image is awful for the environment. Pay an artist.

I [actively block bots](https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/) used for training LLMs and will continue to do so as best I can. I consider it unethical at best to do what the AI companies are doing: scraping the open web first _then_ asking if we want to opt out.

I won't send you emails or messages generated by AI. Likewise if you send me what is obviously an AI generated message, I won't read it. It shows a lack of respect for my time. If you couldn't be bothered to write it, I won't be bothered to read it.
