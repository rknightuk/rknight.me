Want to know about this site? Check out [the colophon](/about/colophon).

### Professional

I am a developer at my day job. I also work part-time as a developer for [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net).

I have a Web Technologies degree from University of Portsmouth as well as a smattering of basically-useless college-level qualifications.

I previously worked in sales at an electrical wholesaler, at a certain fast-food "restaurant", and a brief stint at a second-hand game shop.

### Hobbies

I have two podcasts: [Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com), a tech and food show, and [We Got Family](https://wegot.family), a show about the Fast and Furious movies.

I ship a lot of [weird little websites](/projects) including [Humonize!](https://hum.rknight.me/), [DoubleShift](https://doubleshift.rknight.me/), and the [Brian Butterfield Diet Soundboard](https://treatday.rknight.me/). Occasionally I have a good idea and I make slightly more useful things like [Echo](https://echo.rknight.me/) and the [Monzo Pot Image Generator](https://potimages.rknight.me/).

I have a large collection of Lego, mostly superheroes and vehicles, which you [can see here](/collections/lego). I also [own 14 game consoles and over 300 games](/collections/games) for said consoles.

I'm a big fan of comics and graphic novels but I have yet to catalogue those in any reasonable way.

I'm a member of [#DevsDoDesign](http://devsdodesign.com), an award winning hackathon team.
