**I came to this page because I clicked a link on social media and the page I landed on has the same content, what the hell Robb?**

All my posts are posted to my site first and then automatically shared (or "syndicated") to various social media sites using [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app). This is usually called [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE):

> POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties

[Molly White has a great article on the topic](https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/) if you want a more in-depth look. Although not everyone agrees, I personally think the syndicated post should include a link back to the original source which is why my posts on Mastodon, for example, include a link back.
